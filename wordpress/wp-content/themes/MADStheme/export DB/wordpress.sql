Additionally, each incubator community will need an experienced WordCamp organizer to assist them as a co-lead organizer for their event — if that sounds interesting to you, then you can <a href="https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-co-lead-application">fill in the application form for co-leads</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out further information about the WordCamp Incubator <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/19/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-announcement/">on the Community Team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordPress Meetup Roundtables scheduled for March</h2>\n\n<p>In order to assist local WordPress meetup organizers with running their meetup groups, some members of the Community Team have organized <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/23/wordpress-meetup-roundtables-scheduled-for-march/">weekly meetup roundtable discussions through the month of March</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These will be run as video chats at 16:00 UTC every Wednesday this month and will be a great place for meetup organizers to come together and help each other out with practical ideas and advice.</p>\n\n<p>If you are not already in the WordPress meetup program and would like to join, you can find out more information in <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/">the WordPress Meetup Organizer Handbook</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>GDPR Compliance in WordPress Core</h2>\n\n<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an upcoming regulation that will affect all online services across Europe. In order to prepare for this, a working group has been formed to make sure that WordPress is compliant with the GDPR regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the fact that this will be a requirement for the project going forward, it will also have an important and significant impact on the privacy and security of WordPress as a whole. The working group has posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/19/proposed-roadmap-tools-for-gdpr-compliance/">their proposed roadmap</a> for this project and it looks very promising.</p>\n\n<p>To get involved in building WordPress Core, jump into the #gdpr-compliance channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>WPShout published <a href="https://wpshout.com/complete-guide-wordpress-security/">a thorough guide to WordPress security</a>.</li>\n    <li>The Community Team has published interesting statistics from the WordCamp program in <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/27/wordcamps-in-2016/">2016</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/28/wordcamps-in-2017/">2017</a>.</li>\n    <li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/15/potential-addition-of-a-new-onboarding-team/">An intriguing proposal has been made</a> for a new ‘Onboarding’ team to be started in the WordPress project.</li>\n    <li>The new editing experience for WordPress, named Gutenberg, continues to be actively developed with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/16/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16th-february/">a feature-packed release</a> this past month.</li>\n    <li>The Advanced WordPress Facebook group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vS_jR5-nIo">held an interview with WordPress co-founder, Matt Mullenweg</a> about the Gutenberg project.</li>\n    <li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2018/02/27/two-factor-authentication-on-wp-org/">Two factor authentication is on its way to the WordPress.org network</a> — this will be a great improvement to the overall security of the project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"5613";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:39:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"WordCamp Incubator 2.0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordcamp-incubator-2-0/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 22:53:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Events";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"WordCamp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=5577";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:343:"WordCamps are informal, community-organized events that are put together by a team of local WordPress users who have a passion for growing their communities.

This has worked very well in many communities, with over 120 WordCamps being hosted around the world in 2017.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes though, passionate and enthusiastic community members can’t pull together enough people in their community to make a WordCamp happen. To address this, we introduced <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/experiment-wordcamp-incubator/">the WordCamp Incubator program</a> in 2016.<br /></p>\n\n<p>The goal of the incubator program is <strong>to help spread WordPress to underserved areas by providing more significant organizing support for their first WordCamp event.</strong> In 2016, members of <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/">the global community team</a> worked with volunteers in three cities — Denpasar, Harare and Medellín — giving direct, hands-on assistance in making local WordCamps possible. All three of these WordCamp incubators <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/30/wordcamp-incubator-report/">were a great success</a>, so we&#x27;re bringing the incubator program back for 2018.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Where should the next WordCamp incubators be? If you have always wanted a WordCamp in your city but haven’t been able to get a community started, this is a great opportunity. We will be taking applications for the next few weeks, then will get in touch with everyone who applied to discuss the possibilities. We will announce the chosen cities by the end of March.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>To apply, </strong><a href="https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-city-application"><strong>fill in the application</strong></a><strong> by March 15, 2018.</strong> You don’t need to have any specific information handy, it’s just a form to let us know you’re interested. You can apply to nominate your city even if you don’t want to be the main organizer, but for this to work well we will need local liaisons and volunteers, so please only nominate cities where you live or work so that we have at least one local connection to begin.<br /></p>\n\n<p>We&#x27;re looking forward to hearing from you!<br /></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"5577";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:36:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"WordPress 4.9.4 Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordpress-4-9-4-maintenance-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 Feb 2018 16:17:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"4.9";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=5559";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:350:"WordPress 4.9.4 is now available.

This has changed now and <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/12/wordpress-user-survey-data-for-2015-2017/">the results from the last three surveys are now publicly available</a> for everyone to analyze.</p>\n\n<p>The data will be useful to anyone involved in WordPress since it provides a detailed look at who uses WordPress and what they do with it — information that can help inform product development decisions across the board.</p>\n\n<h2>New WordPress.org Team for the Tide Project</h2>\n\n<p>As announced at WordCamp US, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/tide/2017/12/02/new-home/">the Tide project is being brought under the WordPress.org umbrella</a> to be managed and developed by the community.</p>\n\n<p>Tide is a series of automated tests run against every plugin and theme in the directory to help WordPress users make informed decisions about the plugins and themes that they choose to install.</p>\n\n<p>To get involved in developing Tide, jump into the #tide channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/tide/">the Tide team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>If you’re following the development of Gutenberg, or if you want a primer on where it’s headed, then <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2017/12/10/morten-rand-hendriksen-gutenberg-and-the-wordpress-of-tomorrow/">Morten Rand-Hendriksen’s talk from WordCamp US</a> is a must watch.</li>\n    <li>The annual surveys for WordPress <a href="https://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2017-annual-meetup-member-survey">meetup members</a> and <a href="https://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2017-annual-meetup-organizer-survey">meetup organizers</a> are available for people to fill out — if you’re involved in or attend your local meetup group then be sure to complete those.</li>\n    <li>10up has <a href="https://distributorplugin.com/">a brand new plugin in beta</a> that will assist with powerful and flexible content publishing and syndication across WordPress sites.</li>\n    <li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/12/07/should-we-change-the-default-wordcamp-theme-to-campsite-2017/">The Community Team is exploring a move</a> to make the recently developed CampSite theme the default theme for all new WordCamp websites.

(2016-17).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those who selected &#8220;I own, run, or contribute to a blog or website that is built with WordPress.&#8221; were served questions in what we&#8217;re calling the &#8220;WordPress Users&#8221; group.</p>\n<p>The relevant survey group is noted in each table below. In the case of questions that were served to different groups in 2015 but then served to all respondents in 2016 and 2017, the group responses from 2015 have been consolidated into one set of data for easier comparison between years.</p>\n<h4>Survey results</h4>\n<p><a href="#pro">Jump to answers from WordPress Professionals</a></p>\n<p><a href="#user">Jump to answers from WordPress Users</a></p>\n<p><a href="#all">Jump to answers from All Respondents</a></p>\n<p><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--></p>\n<h3>Which of the following best describes how you use WordPress?

In addition to using up and down arrows, this version introduces the ability to sort blocks by <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/6041">dragging and dropping</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you hover the cursor over the up and down arrows on the left side of a block, you&#8217;ll see a hand icon. Simply click, hold, and drag the block up or down below or above the blue indicator.</p>\n\n\n    \n\n\n<p>In my limited testing, I found drag and drop to be hit or miss. Sometimes, when I try to drag and drop a block, the blue line doesn&#8217;t show up.</p>\n\n<p>The hand icon for the cursor is different for the top and bottom of the block.

Riad Benguella <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/5902">figured out</a> why meta boxes were not collapsing or expanding.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that some meta boxes depend on the post script which has a side effect of calling the window.postboxes.add_postbox_toggles( postType ) twice, causing meta boxes to break.</p>\n\n<p>Gutenberg 2.6 <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/04/05/whats-new-in-gutenberg-5th-april/">released earlier this week</a>, fixes the issue and all meta boxes function properly again. This also fixes the issue I had with the Telegram for WordPress plugin. <br /></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/public-post-preview/">Public Post Preview</a> still doesn&#8217;t work in Gutenberg but the plugin&#8217;s developer, Dominik Schilling, shared some experiments he has conducted with adding support for Gutenberg on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can\'t wait for seeing Gutenberg in WordPress core.

This <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/5913">pull request </a>that made it into Gutenberg 2.6, fixes the issue by only including the term in the Tag selector if it&#8217;s known.</p>\n\n<p>Although I&#8217;m still bummed that certain plugins are not yet compatible with Gutenberg, I&#8217;m pretty happy that two of the major pain points I experienced have been fixed.

After fleshing out the details and discussing the idea over the course of seven months, the duo <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/04/03/want-to-help-organize-a-wordcamp-for-organizers/">has announced</a> that a WordCamp for Organizers is officially on the table.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the event is to provide an opportunity for meetup and WordPress event organizers to share their experience with others in the community. The plan is to host a one-day event a day or two before <a href="https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp US</a> in Nashville, TN, later this year.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The idea for WordCamp for Organizers – what some of us affectionately refer to as &#8216;dotOrganize&#8217; – was really borne out of many conversations I’ve had over the years with others in the WordPress community lamenting the lack of a ready knowledge sharing opportunity between event organizers,&#8221; Jaynes said.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;One common thread seemed to be the idea of common lessons learned, and how awesome it would be to just have an event for organizers to get together and swap tips and tricks. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We’re all here organizing the same community, maybe we should get together and trade notes! And so we now have a new topic-based WordCamp just for organizers. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s kind of meta – organizing a WordCamp for Organizers, but I really feel like this could be a boon for anybody currently organizing or looking to start organizing in WordPress. Exciting!&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Some of the session topics that could be presented on include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Spreading the word about your community events</li>\n    <li>Tips for wrangling speakers, volunteers, and sponsors</li>\n    <li>Conflict resolution among organizing teams</li>\n    <li>How to respond to a code of conduct issue</li>\n    <li>Finding and using official organizing tools and resources<br /></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The team is seeking volunteers who can spend 2-4 hours per week to help organize the event. Although it&#8217;s focused on organizers, those who have attended many conferences, including WordCamps, with little event organizing experience, are encouraged to join the team.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in volunteering, please leave a comment on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/04/03/want-to-help-organize-a-wordcamp-for-organizers/">official announcement post</a>. </p>\n\n<p><br /></p><br /></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 06 Apr 2018 00:22:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"WPTavern: Jetpack 6.0 Takes Steps Towards GDPR Compliance";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=79459";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-6-0-takes-steps-towards-gdpr-compliance";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1148:"<p>Jetpack 6.0 <a href="https://jetpack.com/2018/04/03/jetpack-6-0/">is available</a> for upgrade.

Ironically, at 43 years old I was more fit and healthy than I had ever been in my entire life. I had been running road marathons and trail ultra marathons for a few years leading up to my diagnosis. Good thing too, because surgery and treatment were obviously very tough.</p>\n<p>I was transitioning my design studio from analog to digital. Previously, I was working as a professional artist and illustrator creating commission portraiture and college mascot illustrations with some moderate successes. My background is in Fine Art and Design. I studied Drawing, Sculpture, &amp; Time Arts. (2D, 3D &amp; 4D &#8211; 4D can be described as: Length, width, height, and time/ motion) Naturally, as a Time Arts artist/illustrator I love the web! I love designing for the web and mobile too. Web work is immediately gratifying. I do design for both the web and print but I have always felt drawn to the web as it is more accessible, more fluid, dynamic, interconnected, animated, media rich, and well … if you are reading this then you already get the picture. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<blockquote><p>To get through treatment it was important to me that I still work every day.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some days it was just a couple hours in the afternoon but it really helped me to cope and endure unplanned surgery and many painful chemotherapy treatments. I had recently completed a couple of websites with the help of my mentor Jerry Turk. Those sites had good reach. I mean they were the kind of sites that groups of people used and managed so I got some attention for the work and word of mouth spread locally.</p>\n<p>It was while getting through that period of treatment and the shock of a devastating diagnosis that my digital design agency really got legs. It could not have happened at a better time. So, my studio, C&amp;D Studios &#8211; <a href="https://CandDStudios.com">https://CandDStudios.com</a> continued it’s move towards being 100% digital. No more analog photography and not much more drawing at the drawing table either. Now my work was nearly 100% focused on screens and it would also begin to pay the bills. That was eight years ago. I was very fortunate to learn using reliable frameworks, themes, plug-ins, and hosts that would also stand the test of time. Thank you Genesis Framework, StudioPress and Gravity Forms to name a few…</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2016 after having been cancer free all those years and cranking out a lot of agency work, I had a cancer reoccurrence. I never wanted cancer to be part of my story and I tried to deny or overcome it in all ways but it had resurfaced in October of 2016. Professionally, I was involved in collaborating on very large scale enterprise sites with teams. I was spending the year testing the waters at a new level of production. It was not good timing to require another surgery and 18 more rounds of chemotherapy. Fortunately, I found support in the community from other designers and developers whom helped me to the finish lines with 3 large projects in areas of e-commerce, college membership and enterprise site work -one with a large volume of SVG animations. After surgery, in February of 2017 I completed 18 rounds of chemotherapy treatments.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have survived and am cancer free once again!</p></blockquote>\n<p>While going through treatment the second time I was not really focused on what good thing will I be able to grow towards professionally. Honestly, when you go through these things in life &#8211; you just spend your energy getting through as best as you can. I think it is worth noting here that while a positive attitude is great and it can improve a patient’s overall experience. Please don’t tell people they will survive cancer because of their positive attitude. Cancer is horrible, it does not discriminate and when people can’t beat a disease with their mental attitude they end up blaming themselves unnecessarily. That is not good. That is not what people intend when then try to offer support in that way but that is something I wanted to share.</p>\n<p>Now I have landed on the other side of treatment again and as I reflect, it’s been a really epic year! Our WordPress community has been open and supportive, welcoming me at conferences, online, and in slack groups, whether I had hair, energy, or resources &#8211; always welcoming and always encouraging. Over the years I have made some wonderful friends through WordPress! Some of us have been at this for a long time and we now have many shared experiences and skills.</p>\n<h3>Having Survived Again I’m Launching a WordPress Product</h3>\n<p>Having survived again, and having been inspired at PressNomics in Tempe last spring, I’m busy launching a mobile product/service with my team Dr. Kendra Remington and Rita Best called <a href="https://docswithapps.com">Docs With Apps</a>.</p>\n<p>I still accept some client work, and some retainer work but I’m pretty selective about the projects we work on “in house.”</p>\n<p>I love SVG animation work so in 2018 I’m overjoyed to be doing more contracted SVG animation work with my collaborator Jackie D’Elia. Hit us up!!</p>\n<p>These are some very wonderful times in technology and within the Internet of things. I feel very grateful to have been able to ride the digital wave into the present and future. At WCUS in Nashville I began the process of contributing to make WordPress after having spent many years empowering others with it.</p>\n<p>When I was young I needed a way to get my portfolio on line and that is how I got started. Thank you for the opportunity to share my story, to publicly thank my husband Dominic, my family, and friends too. The future is going to be awesome!</p>\n<p>Take care of yourself and of each other, it&#8217;s very important.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Year%20I%20Got%20Cancer%20Was%20The%20Year%20My%20WordPress%20Business%20Took%20Off&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthe-year-i-got-cancer-was-the-year-my-wordpress-business-took-off%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthe-year-i-got-cancer-was-the-year-my-wordpress-business-took-off%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthe-year-i-got-cancer-was-the-year-my-wordpress-business-took-off%2F&title=The+Year+I+Got+Cancer+Was+The+Year+My+WordPress+Business+Took+Off" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/the-year-i-got-cancer-was-the-year-my-wordpress-business-took-off/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/040418-150x150.jpg&description=The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/the-year-i-got-cancer-was-the-year-my-wordpress-business-took-off/" title="The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/the-year-i-got-cancer-was-the-year-my-wordpress-business-took-off/">The Year I Got Cancer Was The Year My WordPress Business Took Off</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 04 Apr 2018 12:00:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Cathi Bosco";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.9.5 Squashes 25 Bugs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=79399";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-5-squashes-25-bugs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:940:"<p>WordPress 4.9.5 <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2018/04/wordpress-4-9-5-security-and-maintenance-release/">is available</a> for download and is a maintenance and security release.

Jadon N who works for InMotion hosting and is a contributor to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">#hosting-community slack channel</a>, says the hosting-community group is working on ideas to help test popular plugins for Gutenberg compatibility.</p>\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">\n    <p>We have been working to expand our collection of data about how well plugins function with Gutenberg. To help with that effort, we would like to explore using feedback collected from WordPress users through the Try Gutenberg effort to add to the existing database on WordPress plugin compatibility if that could be worked out. </p>\n    <p>The goal of this project is to make sure everyone can use Gutenberg without having to worry about plugin incompatibilities.</p><cite>Jadon N</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href="https://plugincompat.danielbachhuber.com/">Gutenberg Plugin Compatibility Database project</a> launched by Daniel Bachhuber last month attempts to determine which popular plugins are already compatible with Gutenberg by having volunteers test them in a sandboxed environment.</p>\n\n<p>Out of the 4,213 plugins in the database, 84% have an unknown compatibility status. Out of 610 plugins that have been tested, 82% don&#x27;t include editor functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Pendergast <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316#comment:92">supports the idea</a> of hosts collecting a wide range of testing data and turning it into actionable items for the team to work on. There&#x27;s also been some discussion on creating snapshots of plugin compatibility and filtering those results into Bachhuber&#x27;s project.</p>\n\n<p>Chris Lema, Vice President of Products at LiquidWeb, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316#comment:98">responded</a> in the trac ticket with a suggestion that the team place as much emphasis on the Learn More and Report Issues sections as the Try Gutenberg message. He also added a prototype screenshot of what the call-out could look like. <br /></p>\n\n<img />\n    Gutenberg Call Out Prototype by Chris Lema\n\n\n<p>"The reality is that people don&#x27;t read a lot, so people may not fully grasp the &#x27;testing&#x27; part given the proposed design," Lema said. "When there are equal weight to the design, the message also carries with it the same equality."</p>\n\n<p>One of the best suggestions I&#x27;ve read comes <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316#comment:98">from Bachhuber</a>. He suggests displaying the prompt to a small percentage of WordPress sites to prevent thousands of users from re-reporting known issues with Gutenberg. It would also help lessen the load on the support forums.</p>\n\n<p>One of my main concerns with the call-out is the lack of upfront information to the user that it is beta software and it could cause adverse affects on their site. Lema&#x27;s prototype does a great job of informing the user of this possibility and a link to known issues is a great enhancement.

That growth hit a significant milestone this month when <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all">W3Techs reported that WordPress now powers over 30% of sites on the web.</a></p>\n\n<p>The percentage is determined based on W3Techs’ review of the top 10 million sites on the web, and it’s a strong indicator of the popularity and flexibility of WordPress as a platform.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to have hand in helping to grow WordPress even further, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">you can get involved today</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordPress Jargon Glossary Goes Live</h2>\n\n<p>The WordPress Marketing Team has been hard at work lately putting together <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2018/02/28/wordpress-jargon-glossary/">a comprehensive glossary of WordPress jargon</a> to help newcomers to the project become more easily acquainted with things.</p>\n\n<p>The glossary <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2018/02/28/wordpress-jargon-glossary/">is available here</a> along with a downloadable PDF to make it simpler to reference offline.</p>\n\n<p>Publishing this resource is part of an overall effort to make WordPress more easily accessible for people who are not so familiar with the project.

It has reinforced the commitment of the GDPR Compliance Team to continue working on enhancements to WordPress core that allow site owners to improve privacy standards.</p>\n\n<p>The team&#x27;s work, and the wider privacy project, spans four areas: Adding tools which will allow site administrators to collect the information they need about their sites, examining the plugin guidelines with privacy in mind, enhancing privacy standards in WordPress core, and creating documentation focused on best practices in online privacy.</p>\n\n<p>To get involved with the project, you can <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/03/28/roadmap-tools-for-gdpr-compliance/">view the roadmap</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/gdpr-compliance/">follow the updates</a>, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=!closed&keywords=~gdpr">submit patches</a>, and join the #gdpr-compliance channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.

In Gutenberg, that option doesn&#x27;t exist. According to a <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/compatibility-with-gutenberg/">recent support forum post</a>, the author does not plan on making it Gutenberg compatible until there is a finalized API to extend the sidebar.</p>\n\n<h2>Telegram for WordPress</h2>\n\n<p>We use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/telegram-for-wp/">Telegram for WordPress</a> plugin to automatically send published posts to our Telegram channel. The plugin adds a meta box that has options to send the post, configure the message structure, send a file, and display the featured image.</p>\n\n<p>In Gutenberg, the meta box is open by default which provides access to those options. However, when I edit a published post, there are times when the meta box is closed and clicking the arrow to expand it doesn&#x27;t work. <em>Since the Send this post to channel</em> option is on by default, ﻿saving changes to the post will resend the post to Telegram subscribers. Something I don&#x27;t want to happen for simple edits. <br /></p>\n\n<h2>Edit Flow</h2>\n\n<p>We use <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/">Edit Flow</a> to collaborate on posts and often use the Editorial Comments feature to provide feedback. In Gutenberg, the meta boxes for Editorial Comments and Notifications do not open when clicking the arrow. Therefor, we can&#x27;t use those features. <br /></p>\n\n<img />\n    <br /><br />Edit Flow Meta Boxes are Broken\n\n\n<h2>After the Deadline</h2>\n\n<p>I&#x27;m a fan of <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/spelling-and-grammar/">After the Deadline</a> which is a proofreading module in Jetpack. It checks posts for spelling, grammar, and misused words. When activated, a button is added to the visual editor to perform the checks. This button is not available in Gutenberg, so those features are not available as well.</p>\n\n<h2>Adding Images to Paragraphs is a Pain</h2>\n\n<p>Adding images to paragraphs in Gutenberg is more cumbersome than it needs to be. In the current editor, all I have to do is place the cursor where I want to insert an image, add media, choose image size, align it, and I&#x27;m done.</p>\n\n<p>In Gutenberg, you need to create an image block below the paragraph block, move the image block to the paragraph block, align it, and use handlebars on the corner of the image to resize it. </p>\n\n<p>I realize that there are a few workflows that I&#x27;m going to have to change because of how Gutenberg works, but this workflow doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me, especially when I can&#x27;t insert images without creating a new block. Thankfully, the Gutenberg team is on top of it and is <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/5794">working on a solution</a> to add images within a paragraph block.</p>\n\n<h2>Random Blank Paragraph Blocks</h2>\n\n<p>I recently copied a large amount of text from a Google Doc and pasted it into Gutenberg and was surprised by how well it worked. Blocks were created in the right spots and I didn&#x27;t have to edit it much.</p>\n\n<p>I opened the post in the classic editor so that I could use the proofreading feature and it mangled the post. I opened the post in Gutenberg again and noticed a bunch of empty paragraph blocks created in-between paragraph blocks.</p>\n\n<p>This resulted in having to spend some time deleting the empty paragraph blocks and questioning whether I should avoid transferring posts between editors in the future.</p>\n\n<h2>Tags Sometimes Appear Blank in the Meta Box</h2>\n\n<p>When adding tags to posts, sometimes the tags appear blank although they show up on the front-end. Also, deleting tags sometimes doesn&#x27;t work. I click on the X and nothing happens in the back-end, but the tag will be removed from the front-end. <br /></p>\n\n<img />\n    Blank Tags in Gutenberg\n\n\n<h2>Gutenberg Has a Lot of Rough Edges</h2>\n\n<p>If this version of Gutenberg were merged into WordPress today, it would be a disaster. It&#x27;s clear that the project has a long way to go before being considered for merge into core. Most of the issues I&#x27;ve outlined in this post are known and are being addressed. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Gutenberg is supposed to make everything we do in the current editor easier and more efficient. If it doesn&#x27;t, then I have to ask, what&#x27;s the point?</p>\n\n<p>What concerns me the most about Gutenberg is plugin support. Some of the plugins I mentioned above are active on 10K sites or less but are important to the way I craft and publish content in WordPress. <br /></p>\n\n<p> Without them, using Gutenberg is not a great experience and instead, makes me want to use the current editor where things simply work. <br /></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:28:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:11:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"HeroPress: Giving Back In Your Own Community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://heropress.com/?p=2490";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:133:"https://heropress.com/giving-back-in-your-own-community/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=giving-back-in-your-own-community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3298:"<img width="960" height="480" src="https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GoodtimeToBe-HeroPress-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull quote: It is a good time to be part of the global WordPress community: the costs are low, the developer community is strong, and job availability is at an all time high." /><p>I was delighted to find several years ago that there&#8217;s a thriving WordPress community in Nepal.

While a date was not given, Mullenweg said, "For those who want a concrete date, we will have one or two orders of magnitude more users of Gutenberg in April."</p>\n\n<p>It&#x27;s now clear what he meant by that. WordPress 4.9.5, scheduled for release in April, will <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316">feature a call-out prompt</a> that has links to information about Gutenberg and a button to quickly install the plugin if user permissions allow. <br /></p>\n\n<img />\n    Gutenberg Call-out in WordPress 4.9.5\n\n\n<p>The core team added a Try Gutenberg prompt in October of last year but <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-beta-4-removes-try-gutenberg-call-to-action">it was removed</a> in WordPress 4.9 Beta 4. After discussing the subject with Mullenweg, it was determined that Gutenberg was not ready for large-scale testing.</p>\n\n<p>The prompt in WordPress 4.9.5 changes the button text based on the following scenarios.<br /></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>If Gutenberg is not installed, <em>and</em> the user can install plugins, the Install Today button is displayed.<br /></li>\n    <li>If Gutenberg is installed but not activated, <em>and</em> the user can install plugins, the Activate Today button is displayed.<br /></li>\n    <li>If Gutenberg is installed and activated, <em>and</em> the user can edit posts, the Try Today button is displayed.<br /></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If Gutenberg is not installed and the user can not install plugins, the button is hidden from view. If you&#x27;d like to hide the prompt from users, David Decker has <a href="https://github.com/deckerweb/remove-gutenberg-panel">created a plugin</a> that&#x27;s available on GitHub that simply hides it from view.</p>\n\n<p>One of the concerns about the prompt is the lack of warning of the risks involved using beta software on a live site. Gutenberg is beta software that&#x27;s still in development that could <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316#comment:75">adversely affect sites</a>. There is no warning on the call-out box and in two clicks, users can install and activate Gutenberg. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Whether it&#x27;s Gutenberg or some other beta software, this general advice applies.

He bootstrapped his website maintenance and support company, <a href="http://wordx.press">WordXpress</a>, that he’s worked on full-time for more than seven years.</p>\n\n<p>Late last year he launched his first premium plugin, and presented at WordCamp Salt Lake City. He lives in Caldwell, ID and is the founding member of the WordPress Meetup group in Western Idaho. <br /></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>It was only a few months ago that I knew almost nothing about WordPress’ new Gutenberg editor. I had a basic concept of what it was and this vague annoyance that it would mean I’d have to learn new things and probably put a lot of effort into making some sites or projects work with it.</p>\n\n<p>I kept hearing all of the frustration and issues with Gutenberg itself and the lack of information on how to integrate with it. At <a href="https://wordx.press">WordX</a>p<a href="https://wordx.press">ress</a> we recently pivoted away from designing websites. When we designed them in the past, we used premium themes. I figured Gutenberg was the theme developer’s problem.<br /></p>\n\n<p>I still had this feeling of dread though, knowing many of my favorite plugins might not add support for it. I also felt some apprehension that even if the themes we use did add support for it, they might have a lot of new bugs through the first few releases.</p>\n\n<p>Then I launched my first WordPress plugin, <a href="https://starfishwp.com">Starfish Reviews</a>, and suddenly they weren’t someone else’s problems anymore! Now I’d have to come up with a plan to integrate our plugin with Gutenberg. I installed the Gutenberg plugin on a test site where we were testing our plugin with the nightly releases of WordPress and started playing around with it.</p>\n\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised at how intuitive and easy it was to use! Now it wasn’t (and isn’t) finished, so there were bugs and annoyances, but overall I was impressed.</p>\n\n<p>Around the same time, I suggested we should have someone present on Gutenberg at our local meetup. My brief experience was more than what anyone else had, so the responsibility fell on me. Preparing for the presentation forced me to look at Gutenberg more carefully and pay more attention to the information and debate going on throughout the community.</p>\n\n<p>I started reading blog posts, paying more attention in podcasts, and even looking at what was being said on Twitter. I watched the State of the Word at WordCamp US where the general tide in the feelings toward Gutenberg, seemed to turn, though many people still remain skeptical, critical, or antagonistic toward the project as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I saw someone suggesting legal action if Gutenberg caused problems on their sites. That’s ridiculous on several levels, but shows that there’s still a lot of suspicion, frustration, and outright anger around Gutenberg.</p>\n\n<p><em>A couple notes: 1. the graphs below are for illustration purposes only, they’re not meant to be accurate to any actual data. 2. If you prefer listening, you can </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4ZqrVJ465E"><em>watch my screencast version</em></a><em> (13:12) of what follows. The message is the same, but differs in many aspects of presentation.</em></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Finding the Why</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Simon Sinek is known for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA">his Ted talk</a> where he explains that most people explain a new product or service by talking about ‘what’ it is and ‘how’ it works, but they rarely explain the ‘why’ behind it. The ‘why’ actually resonates with people the most. They want to understand the reason and beliefs behind it.</p>\n\n<p>In my research, I couldn’t seem to find a clear answer to the most important question: “Why Gutenberg?” If I was going to present to people who knew little or nothing about it, I wanted to provide a reason why this major change was coming that might cause significant frustration, work, and pain for them.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>I found a lot of ‘what’ and ‘how’ about Gutenberg. In some posts by <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">Matt Mullenweg</a> and <a href="https://matiasventura.com/post/gutenberg-or-the-ship-of-theseus/">Matías Ventura</a>, I found hints about ‘why’ Gutenberg existed, but no really clear, simple explanation of why this whole project was happening. Why would Matt and others want to seemingly force this major change on us all? Why does it have to be such a radical departure from the past? Why now?</p>\n\n<p>I was certain the conspiracy theorists—who seem to believe that Automattic’s sole mission is to make their lives more miserable—were wrong. But what was the purpose? Could it really just be a <strong>me too</strong> attitude that left all of these brilliant minds feeling like they had to keep up with Squarespace and Medium? That didn’t seem to fit. Especially since Gutenberg is already leagues better than Squarespace’s convoluted visual editor.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Innovative Disruption</strong></h2>\n\n<img />\n    The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma Book Cover\n\n\n<p>Taking cues from those hints and suggestions, I started thinking about the innovative disruption model. It was popularized in business circles, starting in 1997 when the book “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a>” was published by Clayton Christensen, a Harvard professor. His book was an expansion of an <a href="https://hbr.org/1995/01/disruptive-technologies-catching-the-wave">earlier article</a> in the Harvard Business Review.</p>\n\n<p>At the risk of oversimplifying the model, innovative disruption is what happens when an existing company who is the top dog (either in sales or market share) gets comfortable with their position at the top along with their revenue stream and quits innovating. They make small, incremental updates to their products or services to keep customers happy, but fail to look at the future of their industry.</p>\n\n<p>This makes it easier for a startup or smaller, more innovative company to bring a new product or service to market that completely disrupts the existing market because it’s better, faster, cheaper. The established company doesn’t see the disruption coming because they feel secure in their large market share and steady sales revenue. They often respond with “why would anyone want that?” when approached with the new model that is about to completely upset their business model.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Blockbuster Gets Busted</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The classic example of this is Blockbuster Entertainment, Inc. They had over 9,000 stores at one time, allowing people to rent VHS tapes and later, DVDs. They had a huge portion of the market all to themselves and it seemed nobody could compete with this juggernaut.</p>\n\n<p>Then along came two small startups: Netflix and Redbox. Netflix comes along and says “we’re going to stream movies over the internet. That’s the future and the way everyone will want to consume movies and TV in the future. But since the internet is too slow right now, we’ll just start by mailing DVDs to people.”</p>\n\n<p>Blockbuster looked at this and said, “the internet is <em>way</em> too slow to stream movies. That’s ridiculous! Who wants to wait two weeks to get a movie in the mail?! Hahaha! Stupid startup, they’re wasting their money and energy.” In hindsight this seems ridiculous. At the time, most people would have agreed with Blockbuster.</p>\n\n<p>As you know, people started changing the way they rented movies. Once they tried it, they were happy to pay a subscription and use a queue to get DVDs delivered in the mail. Ultimately, making the decision of what to watch ahead of time was better than wandering through a cathedral of DVDs only to find the one you wanted to watch has already been checked out.</p>\n\n<p>Consumer internet bandwidth speeds quickly caught up. Netflix even invented some of the technologies that provide high quality streaming video to your home. Now, most of us can’t imagine having to go to the store to rent a physical copy of a movie. And those that can, get them from a Redbox kiosk that has a limited selection, but is much quicker and easier than a video store. Netflix now has a larger market share than Blockbuster ever did, with <em>zero</em> physical locations.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>There are exactly nine Blockbuster stores still operating, mostly in Alaska. From 9,000 down to nine in only a few years! This is what failing to innovate does. This is how comfort and confidence in market share and sales blinds people and organizations to the coming innovations that will disrupt their market.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Literacy, Disruption, and Gutenberg</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Disruptive innovation doesn’t apply just in business. I have a Bachelor’s degree in history. So one example I love to use is how literacy and education ultimately toppled monarchies and traditional power structures in favor of republics and representative democracy.</p>\n\n<p>The choice of Gutenberg as the name of the new WordPress editor seems prescient in this example as well. The name was one of the clues that led me to answer the ‘why?’ question. It was Johannes Gutenberg and his movable type printing press that was the innovative disruption that changed everything!</p>\n\n<p>Before that, the vast majority of people in Europe were illiterate and uneducated. The scarcity of books and written material made it impractical and prohibitively expensive for most people to learn to read. It also allowed the Church and aristocracy to control the opportunity to become literate. That meant the rich and powerful were the gatekeepers of knowledge. Most riots and uprisings to this point were about hunger.</p>\n\n<p>The Gutenberg press changed all that. Suddenly books could be mass-produced faster, cheaper, better than they ever could before. Literacy caught on like a wildfire. The power structures thought they could control it and maintain the status quo. They outlawed printing without state approval and did many other things to limit the spread of ideas through printed materials.</p>\n\n<p>But it was too late, the power to spread ideas that the printing press provided was much too viral. Many printing presses were operated illegally, then destroyed when they were discovered by authorities.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>The tipping point had been reached though. The ability to read and spread ideas via printed documents was much more powerful than the money, soldiers, and weapons of the monarchy. Though hunger might have sparked riots and uprisings from this time on, those tiny flames were fanned into an inferno of revolution by ideas spread through printed words. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine">Thomas Paine</a>’s Common Sense is a great example if you want to learn more about concrete examples.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The Pain of Disrupting Yourself</strong></h2>\n\n<p>I don’t have a business degree, but from my understanding, <em>The Innovator’s Dilemma</em> can be simplified down to this: to survive, and stay on top, a company (or software, or community) must innovate. It <em>can not</em> be incremental innovation. It <em>must</em> be innovation that disrupts the company’s core product or business model, even to the point of entirely replacing it.</p>\n\n<p>Blockbuster tried some Redbox-like and Netflix-like solutions, but they were too little, too late. The only way they could have survived would have been to disrupt their own business model and service. They would have had to say, “in five years we will close all 9k stores and completely shift our business to providing video online.”</p>\n\n<p>Who does that? Who thinks “we have built an empire, but we have to completely change it and replace it all over again”? That’s “The Innovator’s Dilemma” that the book’s title refers to: it’s incredibly difficult to think in those terms when you’re on the top. It’s nearly impossible to say, “we have to disrupt ourselves. We must compete with our own business and products and services.” But ultimately it’s the only way to survive.</p>\n\n<p>…Or you can buy an innovative company and let them disrupt your main business. Did you know Blockbuster had the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blockbuster-ceo-passed-up-chance-to-buy-netflix-for-50-million-2015-7">chance to buy Netflix</a> for $50 million in 2000? It was pocket change, but they passed because it was a very small, niche business.</p>\n\n<p>Had they bought Netflix and allowed it to continue innovating and disrupting their core retail rental model, Blockbuster might still be around. It wouldn’t have 9k retail stores, but it would have an even larger market share than it ever did renting DVDs.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>In either case, the process is painful. That’s why it’s called disruptive. Not because it’s a walk on the beach or small speed bump, but because it takes a lot of work and forward-thinking and causes a lot of pain to create and implement.</p>\n\n<p>If you are the market leader, you can’t rest on your previous success. You have to change everything once again, like you did to get to where you are now. Despite the pain of doing it, you have to invest yourself and your resources into hard work and difficult questions and challenging thinking that goes directly counter to our natural tendency as humans. If you want to stay on top, it’s the only way.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>WordPress is Ripe for Disruption</strong></h2>\n\n<p>WordPress has a 30% market share right now. It won’t be long before 1 out of every 3 websites is built on WordPress. No other platform is even close.</p>\n\n<p>As WordPress professionals and community members, it seems like we have all the momentum and benefits of being the leader. “Surely nothing could displace WordPress!” That’s what Blockbuster said. That’s what monarchs of past ages said. The truth is simple: “yes, something could. In fact, something will, if WordPress doesn’t innovatively disrupt itself.”</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>Is it going to be painful? Yes. Is it going to cause a lot of work and effort on the part of the community? Yes! Absolutely. But the alternative is to learn a totally new platform in five years when WordPress dies like Blockbuster did. You think this change is going to be difficult? Try throwing out WordPress entirely and moving your website(s) to an entirely new platform. Because that’s the alternative.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Good Arguments Against Gutenberg</strong></h2>\n\n<p>I see many people listing a string of bugs in the Gutenberg UI/UX and concluding that Gutenberg shouldn’t exist. I see others critiquing the underlying technologies and claiming that’s evidence that Gutenberg is entirely wrong.</p>\n\n<p>I’m sorry, but those arguments are entirely invalid. They may be great arguments for how Gutenberg needs to change or improve, but they are <em>not</em> valid arguments against the existence of Gutenberg and its inclusion in core.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully, I’ve made it clear that WordPress is in dire need of innovation. If that’s true, then as I see it, there’s only one really great argument against Gutenberg. As one person in one of the meetups I presented at put it: “is it the right innovation?”</p>\n\n<p>That&#x27;s the crux of the whole thing: <strong>WordPress must innovate to survive</strong>. Matt Mullenweg and the entire Gutenberg team have looked at the past and the future and decided that a better, faster, easier user interface and experience, are the disruptive innovations that WordPress needs to survive.</p>\n\n<p>You can argue that it’s not, that there’s some other innovation that will completely change WordPress and thereby save it from disruption by outside forces. And that&#x27;s a totally valid argument to make. But in my opinion, <strong>you can’t argue that continued, incremental changes are enough.</strong> You can’t argue that the path we’ve been on the last five years is going to keep WordPress on top for the next five years. It simply won’t.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>I Like Gutenberg, but I Love What it’s Doing</strong></h2>\n\n<p>In my experience thus far, I like Gutenberg. I believe it is the right disruptive innovation WordPress needs at this time. It will make WordPress easier to use and help its underpinnings be ready for the future. Being easy to use is what got WordPress where it is today.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not very easy to use any more. There are significantly easier options out there, that could disrupt WordPress and replace it. I think Gutenberg will allow WordPress to disrupt itself and keep ahead of other disruptive innovations. It will save WordPress and allow us all to keep using it and building our businesses on it for another 10 years into the future.</p>\n\n<p>I like Gutenberg, but I really love what Gutenberg means, what it represents, and what it&#x27;s doing. Gutenberg is bigger than just a new post editor, it shows that the leaders of the WordPress community are willing to make hard decisions and innovate even when it means disrupting their own work and previous innovations.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>I have huge respect for the Gutenberg team, who have not only had to rethink everything and do all those difficult things I referred to before, but have had to do it all very publicly, while navigating a gauntlet of criticism, personal attacks, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this post shows my thanks and newfound appreciation for what they’re doing and going through. Flipping the phrase from <em>The Dark Knight,</em> the members of the Gutenberg team are “the heroes the WordPress community needs right now, even if they’re not the ones we deserve.”</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 18:20:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"Post Status: The Future of Content Distribution — Draft podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=44599";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"https://poststatus.com/future-content-distribution-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2385:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

As most of you can probably imagine, BuddyPress was a different piece of software back then, trying to solve a completely different decade&#8217;s worth of problems for a completely different version of WordPress.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress was multisite only, meaning it did not work on the regular version of WordPress that most people were accustomed to installing. It needed to completely take over the entire website experience to work, with a specific theme for the primary part of your site, and blog themes for user profiles and everything else.</p>\n<p>There was a lot to love about the original vision and version of BuddyPress. It was ambitious, but in a clever kind of way that made everyone tilt their heads, squint their eyes, and ponder what WordPress was capable of. BuddyPress knew exactly what it was trying to do, and owned it without apologies.</p>\n<p>It touted itself as a &#8220;Social Network in a box&#8221; at a time when MySpace was generating 75.9 million <em>unique</em> visitors per month, so if you couldn&#8217;t imagine how different BuddyPress may have been before, imagine how excited everyone was at the idea of owning their own MySpace.</p>\n<p>Since then, Andy invited <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/boonebgorges">Boone</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/djpaul">Paul</a>, and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby">me</a> to help lead the project forward, and in-turn we&#8217;ve invited several other prolific BuddyPress contributors to help with every aspect of the project, website, design, and so on.</p>\n<p>The BuddyPress team has grown in a few different ways. Most recently, we&#8217;ve added <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/espellcaste">Renato Alves</a> to the team to help with WP-CLI support. Renato is a long-time contributor who stepped up big-time to really own the WP-CLI implementation and finally see it through to the end.</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/slaffik">Slava Abakumov</a> lead the 2.8 release, and we finally met in person for the very first time just last week at WordCamp Miami. He&#8217;s another long-time contributor who has always had the best interests of the project in mind and at heart.</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/offereins">Laurens Offereins</a> has been helping fix BuddyPress bugs and work on evolving features since version 2.1, and while we haven&#8217;t met in person <em>yet</em>, I look forward to it someday!</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/netweb">Stephen Edgar</a> (who you may recognize from bbPress) also works a bit on BuddyPress, largely around tooling &amp; meta related things, but he&#8217;s fully capable and will jump in and help anywhere he can, be it the forums or features.</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mercime">Mercime</a> would prefer I not blather on endlessly here about how important she is, or how much I appreciate her, or anything like that, so please forget I mentioned it.</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/hnla">Hugo Ashmore</a> has spent the past 2 years completely rebuilding the default template pack. This is an absolutely huge undertaking, and everyone is really excited about sunsetting ye olde <code>bp-legacy</code>.</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/karmatosed">Tammie Lister</a> has moved on to work on the enormously important and equally ambitious <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">Gutenberg</a> project. Tammie is wonderful, and doing a great job crafting what the future of democratizing publishing is.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a few of our veteran team members took sabbaticals from contributing to BuddyPress in the past few years, which I see as an opportunity to return with fresh ideas and perspectives, or maybe moving onto new &amp; exciting challenges. This is a good, healthy thing to do, both for oneself and the project. Space makes the heart grow fonder, and all that.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A small aside but worth saying here &amp; now, is that leading an open-source project is everything you think it is (or maybe have read already that it is) and like a million other things that are hard to understand until you understand. The one constant (and subsequently the hardest and funnest part) is how to provide opportunities for personal growth, without prohibiting contributions, while also doing what&#8217;s best for the greater vision of the project itself, amongst a completely remote group of bespoke volunteers. I think Paul, Boone, and I do OK at this, but we are always learning and adjusting, so please reach out to us if there is anything we can do differently or better.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>BuddyPress is my personal favorite piece of software. It&#8217;s my favorite community. I wake up excited every day because of what it can do and who it does it for. Put another way, I love what we make it do and who we make it for: ourselves, one another, each other, and you.</p>\n<p>Cheers to 10 years, and here&#8217;s to another 10!</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-271562 size-full" src="https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-25-at-4.38.12-PM.png" alt="" width="898" height="452" /></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 25 Mar 2018 22:54:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"JJJ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"WPTavern: Noteworthy Changes Coming in WordPress 4.9.5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=78611";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"https://wptavern.com/noteworthy-changes-coming-in-wordpress-4-9-5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2401:"<p>WordPress 4.9.5 Beta 1 <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/03/21/wordpress-4-9-5-beta/">is available</a> for testing and brings with it 23 bug fixes and improvements. A release candidate is scheduled for release on March 20th and a final release on April 3rd. Here are some notable changes you can expect in the release.</p>\n\n<h3>"Cheatin’ uh?" Error Message is Replaced</h3>\n\n<p>The "Cheatin’ uh?" error message has existed in WordPress for years and for some, is insulting. The error doesn&#x27;t explain what went wrong and accuses the user of trying to cheat the system.</p>\n\n<img />\n    Cheatin&#x27; Uh Error Message<br />\n\n\n<p>Eric Meyer highlighted the error in <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2016/06/24/eric-a-meyer-design-for-real-life/">his keynote</a> at WordCamp North East Ohio in 2016, when talking about Designing for Real Life. He also <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38332#comment:11">contributed to the ticket</a> with suggestions on how to improve the wording.</p>\n\n<p>In WordPress 4.9.5, the error <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38332">has been changed</a> to more meaningful messages depending on the error that occurs.</p>\n\n<h3>Recommended PHP Version Increased to 7.2</h3>\n\n<p>Inside of the readme file in WordPress, the current recommended PHP version is 7.0. This version of PHP reached end of life last December. In 4.9.5, the recommend version is PHP 7.2. This is the same version that is <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/">recommended on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Offensive Lyrics Removed From Hello Dolly</h3>\n\n<p>As we covered <a href="https://wptavern.com/without-context-some-lyrics-inside-the-hello-dolly-plugin-are-degrading-to-women">earlier this week</a>, some of the lines displayed in the dashboard from the Hello Dolly plugin are inappropriate without context. In 4.9.5, the plugin will no longer display those lines.</p>\n\n<p>There&#x27;s a possibility that in the future, there will be a musical note icon or symbol placed next to the line to indicate it&#x27;s from a song. In addition, the lyrics are more in line with Louis Armstrong&#x27;s recording.</p>\n\n<p>To see a full list of changes in WordPress 4.9.5, you can <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=4.9.5&group=component">view a full list</a> of closed tickets on Trac. </p>\n\n<p><br /></p><br /></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 21:32:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 309 – All AMPed Up";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=78601&preview=true&preview_id=78601";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-309-all-amped-up";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2180:"<p>In this episode, I&#8217;m joined by <a href="https://medinathoughts.com/">Alberto Medina</a>, Developer Advocate working with the Web Content Ecosystems Team at Google, and <a href="https://weston.ruter.net/">Weston Ruter</a>, CTO of XWP.

The business side isn&#8217;t nearly as loving and supportive as the community side, and some of that is out of necessity. Business is business, and people need to eat.</p>\n<p>The problem comes when people get so focused on the business side of things that they forget they&#8217;re dealing with people. Recently <a href="https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/971182969514799105">Carl Hancock mentioned on twitter</a> that there are things that happen in business in the WordPress community that would horrify people. I don&#8217;t know who those people are that do those things, and I don&#8217;t even know what the things are, but I have hope that the community can be bigger and better than that.</p>\n<p>There will always be selfish jerks who abuse the system for personal gain, but I have hope that the WordPress community can generally rise above that, and perhaps even change the hearts of poor players.</p>\n<p>This week&#8217;s HeroPress replay is from David Laietta, about how our community changes lives.</p>\n<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content"><p><a href="https://heropress.com/essays/a-community-of-acceptance/">A Community of Acceptance</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Keeping Community Alive" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Keeping%20Community%20Alive&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fkeeping-community-alive%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Keeping Community Alive" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fkeeping-community-alive%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fkeeping-community-alive%2F&title=Keeping+Community+Alive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Keeping Community Alive"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/keeping-community-alive/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/090716-David-Laietta-150x150.jpg&description=Keeping Community Alive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Keeping Community Alive"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/keeping-community-alive/" title="Keeping Community Alive"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/keeping-community-alive/">Keeping Community Alive</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 15:39:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"WPTavern: A Plea For Plugin Developers to Stop Supporting Legacy PHP Versions";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=78533";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"https://wptavern.com/a-plea-for-plugin-developers-to-stop-supporting-legacy-php-versions";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2188:"<p>Iain Poulson has <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/legacy-php-version-support/">published a thoughtful request</a> on the Delicious Brains blog asking WordPress plugin developers to stop supporting legacy PHP versions.

You can also follow the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core-php/">#core-php tag</a> on the Make WordPress.org Core site where links to chat logs and meeting summaries are published. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 00:31:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"WPTavern: How to Disable Push Notification Requests in Firefox";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=78475";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"https://wptavern.com/how-to-disable-push-notification-requests-in-firefox";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1246:"<p>Have you noticed how many sites ask if you want to enable push notifications?

Seven years ago, it was <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15769">argued</a> that the lyrics are copyrighted and could potentially violate the GPL license.</p>\n\n<p>The latest issue with Hello Dolly is that some lyrics that appear in users dashboards with the plugin activated can be degrading to women without context.</p>\n\n<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Find her an empty lap, fellas.<br /><br />Wondering about my <a href="https://twitter.com/WordPress?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WordPress</a> dashboard.

"The Hello Dolly plugin has been bundled in WordPress for many years, being a simple example of how to build a plugin for WordPress while also adding a bit of whimsy to admin," he said.</p>\n\n<p>"However, there are several passages of text from this song which are inappropriate to display without any context to people using WordPress—particularly as the WordPress project seeks to promote inclusivity for all."</p>\n\n<p>The discussion within the ticket suggests creating a black list or replacing the lyrics with less offensive versions. In many of the Google search results for Hello Dolly lyrics by Jerry Herman, shows that the lyrics inside the plugin and those in the song are different.</p>\n\n<p>The lyrics say, "Find me a vacant knee, fellas." In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RETJfq1U_gg">video on YouTube</a> of Hello Dolly featuring Sarah Gardner singing the lyrics, she clearly says "Find her an empty lap, fellas." In a YouTube video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmfeKUNDDYs">Louis Armstrong singing Hello Dolly live</a>, he says "Find her an empty lap, fellas."<br /></p>\n\n<p>Putting aside the debate of which version of the lyrics are used, displaying the text above without context can and is seen as degrading women. At a time when WordPress and its community are doing what it can to be more inclusive, changing or removing the lyrics seems like an easy win. </p>\n\n<p></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 20:45:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"WPTavern: Watch WordCamp Miami 2018 Via Free Livestream";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=78359";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"https://wptavern.com/watch-wordcamp-miami-2018-via-free-livestream";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:618:"<p>Tickets for the event may be sold out, but you can watch the event from anywhere thanks to a <a href="https://2018.miami.wordcamp.org/live/">free livestream</a>.

Post Status Draft is hosted by Brian Krogsgard and co-host Brian Richards.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Brian and Brian discuss the power of network effects and how they relate to WordPress’ increasing market share and maturity. WordPress has recently hit two major milestones, turning 15 years old and reaching 30% market share of the top 10 million websites, and we spend this episode reflecting on the innovations that brought us here and where innovations are likely to occur over the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>We’ve come quite a long way in these 15 years. From the famous 5-minute install to being entirely pre-installed. From a supportive band of volunteers and vast ecosystem of free software to the commercially supported and highly-polished products that exist today. There is a lot about WordPress to be thankful for, and a lot of great things that will exist in the future because of it. And you can hear a bit about all of that on this episode of the Post Status Draft podcast.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://medium.com/evergreen-business-weekly/the-power-of-network-effects-why-they-make-such-valuable-companies-and-how-to-harness-them-5d3fbc3659f8">The Power of Network Effects</a></li>\n<li>Mel Choice&#8217;s LoopConf presentation on <a href="https://loopconf.com/talk/customizing-the-future/">Customizing the Future</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sponsor: Yoast</h3>\n<p>Yoast SEO Premium gives you 24/7 support from a great support team and extra features such as a redirect manager, recommended internal links, tutorial videos and integration with Google Webmaster Tools!

I&#8217;ll share what I did each time the growing business started to threaten my lifestyle, and how you can do the same.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>I had a traditional full-time job throughout my 20’s. I enjoyed building my career and earning a regular salary, but didn’t like the lack of flexibility that came with it.</p>\n<p>I didn’t like having to arrive at work by a fixed time, or being unable to choose when I worked. As a hard-working person, it felt counter-productive to be forced to work set hours when I may not be at my best.</p>\n<p>My daily commute was anything from 25-50 minutes (which I realise is less than many people). It felt like a waste of time as I could work just as well from home, not to mention the environmental impact of driving so far just to sit in an office. Day-to-day tasks such as ordering items for home delivery became a big deal, as I wasn’t home during the day.</p>\n<p>As a result, I spent most of my 20’s simultaneously building my career in a traditional job, while dreaming about running my own business and working for myself. Andy felt the same about his own job as a senior software developer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think that most people want a better lifestyle, but not many actually do anything about it. I thought I was one of those people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Andy and I would talk endlessly about different business ideas (most of them terrible!) and even experimented with building a few websites that were never launched. However, we didn’t have the drive to make it happen and launch a business in the real world.</p>\n<h2>Starting a Business</h2>\n<p>In late 2009, Andy had finally had enough of his job and we agreed that it was time for him to quit. We decided to start a web design business together. He would work solely on the new business, while I would support it alongside my main job (which I didn&#8217;t hate, even though I didn&#8217;t like the lifestyle).</p>\n<p>We started by building WordPress websites for small local businesses. Andy built the websites and I was responsible for copywriting and marketing. We approached local tradespeople who didn&#8217;t already have a website &#8211; back in 2010, there were still a lot of these! Our first clients were local plumbers, electricians, a washing machine repair shop, etc.</p>\n<p>These early projects were quite low budget. The average hourly rate was quite low because we were still learning and hadn&#8217;t perfected our processes yet. We wasted a lot of time on projects where we had under-quoted but were committed to honoring the agreed price.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We made a lot of mistakes, and learned from them all!</p></blockquote>\n<p>By Year 2, the business was making the equivalent of a fairly low salary for one person. However, we had to work a lot for a relatively small income. This encouraged us to work more hours, and it wasn&#8217;t bringing the lifestyle benefits I was looking for.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle Tip #1: Learn to Specialize</h2>\n<p>In late 2010, it occurred to me that we were building all our websites in WordPress but not advertising ourself as a WordPress company. I wondered whether people were actually searching for WordPress experts and whether this could be a good way to advertise. That may seem obvious in 2018 now WordPress is the world&#8217;s biggest web platform &#8211; but it was a genuine question back in 2010.</p>\n<p>On a whim, I invested $100 in Google AdWords targeting keywords such as &#8216;WordPress web design&#8217; and &#8216;WordPress developer&#8217;. Amazingly, we were overwhelmed with enquiries and quickly brought in over $4,000 of business &#8211; not a bad return on investment! The work came from medium sized companies who had never used our services before, with higher budgets.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Positioning ourselves as WordPress specialists completely changed the profile of our client base, as well as the budgets we were working with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This vastly increased our average hourly income, so we were making more money without having to work more hours. Finally, it felt like a proper business with a better work-life balance.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle Tip #2: Build a (virtual) team</h2>\n<p>The business grew quickly under its new identity as a specialist WordPress agency. By mid-2011, we had more work than we could manage ourselves. I also had a baby and increased my hours on the business while on maternity leave &#8211; eventually not returning to my old job. We still needed to increase the company&#8217;s income, while working towards the lifestyle we wanted.</p>\n<p>We grew the business to the next level by building a virtual team.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I felt quite strongly that I didn&#8217;t want to become a traditional employer with a team of staff, all working together in an office. That would bring me back to the lifestyle I started with!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead, I decided to recruit a team of freelancers.</p>\n<p>It took time to find the right freelancers, but the good news is that you can try someone out on a single project with no further commitment. If it doesn&#8217;t work out, then you don&#8217;t have to work with them again. Through trial and error, I built a team of freelancers with different WordPress-related skills. This increased capacity and allowed us to take on more projects without having to work more hours.</p>\n<p>I was still managing all the projects, but could take a step back and wasn&#8217;t directly building the websites. Finally, it felt like a proper WordPress agency.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle Tip #3: Selling WordPress products</h2>\n<p>By building a distributed team, the business became more and more successful. We were taking on more and more projects, and I was managing all of them. By the time we were running 20 projects at once, I had reached the limits of my capacity and was having to work a lot of hours.</p>\n<p>From 2014-15, I experimented with working with freelance project managers, but had to give up because quality was dropping and our clients were less happy. I realised that with the current business model, I could only continue growing the business by working more and more hours. This wasn&#8217;t what I had been working towards!</p>\n<p>It was time for Andy and I to pursue our other dream: selling WordPress products. We&#8217;d been talking about this since the early days of the business, but the client projects had kept us so busy that we&#8217;d never done anything about it.</p>\n<p>In early 2016, Andy stepped out of the client business and started writing WordPress and WooCommerce plugins to sell. I continued managing client projects for the next 6 months, until the plugins were making enough money to stop taking on new projects and I could spend all my time marketing and supporting the plugins.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Selling WordPress plugins has been very successful because we already knew the market inside out from our years of developing WordPress sites.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We knew where the gaps were and what plugin customers want. We knew where other plugin companies get it wrong, and could learn from their mistakes without making the same mistakes ourselves!</p>\n<p>By launching several plugins, we could listen to what our customers were asking for and build even more. In October 2016, we launched our <a href="https://barn2.co.uk/wordpress-plugins/woocommerce-product-table/">WooCommerce Product Table plugin</a> because so many people asked for a way to list products in a table with add to cart buttons. This immediately became our bestselling plugin and has sold more than all our other plugins combined. Since then, the plugin business has gone from strength to strength.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have found that selling WordPress products brings a much better work-life balance than providing WordPress services.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We receive (many) plugin support requests every day, but each one takes relatively little time and is less pressured than fixing problems for web design clients. The whole business feels much more relaxed, and I don&#8217;t feel guilty about taking time off.</p>\n<p>Between the two of us, we spend a couple of hours a day on plugin support. We continue improving the plugins, marketing, adding features and building the business on top of that. However, all of this is optional and can easily be done while working part-time.</p>\n<h2>Snow Day! Putting It Into Practice</h2>\n<p>Before we finish, I&#8217;ll tell you about my week. Today is Friday. At 10.30am on Wednesday, I received a text that my daughter&#8217;s school had closed for the rest of the week because of the unusual snow here in the UK.</p>\n<p>The parents with traditional jobs panicked and had to quickly arrange childcare or time-off work. Some of them were stuck in cars on snowed-in roads as they tried to return to the village. No one could get to work the next day. A lot of people lost a lot of money.</p>\n<p>Andy and I simply stopped work, put on our snow gear, walked the 10 minutes to the school, and then went sledging. Since then, we&#8217;ve been sharing the childcare in between responding to plugin support requests (and writing this article!). We&#8217;ve had 37 plugin sales on our website since the school closed, even though we&#8217;ve been working less hours than usual. Now, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been working towards!</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve worked hard and have been extremely committed to building Barn2 Media. However, this has always been on the condition that it wouldn&#8217;t sacrifice my lifestyle goals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For me, the ideal business is measured against a combination of financial success and lifestyle benefits. If the founders are working 70 hours a week to keep the money coming in, then it&#8217;s not a successful business!</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can do the same. Design a WordPress business that will give you the lifestyle you want, as well as making money. If you love working with people, build a team and provide WordPress services (WordPress design and development are good for this). If you want to travel, choose work that you can do remotely from different time zones (WordPress products are good for this). Plan your business around what matters to you.</p>\n<p>WordPress is such a huge ecosystem that it comes with many opportunities to build a successful business. With a bit of extra thought and planning, you can build a WordPress business that is successful AND lets you life the lifestyle you&#8217;ve always wanted.

It turned out to be a complex, obscure vulnerability that ignited a conversation surrounding the security of api.wordpress.org and what could happen if the servers were compromised.</p>\n<p>One idea that was brought forth is to digitally sign WordPress core, theme, and plugin updates. For at least five years, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25052">a trac ticket</a> has laid semi-dormant with this idea in mind.</p>\n<p>Fifteen months ago, Scott Arciszewski, Chief Development Officer for Paragon Initiative Enterprises, who is most widely known for his <a href="https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/02/cryptographically-secure-php-development">cryptography engineering work</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214062414/https://medium.com/@CiPHPerCoder/stopmullware-on-the-security-of-27-of-the-websites-on-the-internet-298a7e5b6871">published an article</a> that has since been taken down, expressing his strong desire for Matt Mullenweg to make secure cryptographic signatures a priority. Mullenweg responded to his post with <a href="https://medium.com/@photomatt/wordpress-and-update-signing-51501213e1">one of his own</a> stating that although WordPress update signing is important, it&#8217;s not a high priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will at some point; as said above it’s a good idea — can’t hurt, might help,&#8221; Mullenweg responded when asked if WordPress was ever going to do update signing. &#8220;There are, however, some more important security issues in front of it, that impact millions of sites in the real world, so we are prioritizing those issues above a nice-to-have, defense in-depth effort.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Eric Mann Launches Secure WordPress Updates Plugin</h2>\n<p>While WordPress does not digitally sign updates, Eric Mann, founder of <a href="https://displace.tech/">Displace Technologies, LLC</a>, has <a href="https://ttmm.io/tech/introducing-secure-updates-for-wordpress/">created and released</a> a new plugin that adds code signing to WordPress core updates. It&#8217;s called DGXPCO or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/dgxpco/">Digital Guarantees for eXplicitly Permitted Core Operations</a>. You&#8217;ll find it on the plugin directory by searching for DGXPCO.</p>\n<p>When installed and activated, the plugin integrates with the core updater and requires that any core update must have a valid signature before it can be installed. The signature provides a secondary source of truth that confirms the integrity of the files. The signatures are created using a Ed25519 public/private keypair and <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">Libsodium</a> to sign the files’ contents.</p>\n<p>Mann keeps the private key offline and has published the public key online. The public key will not change and if a core update is signed by a different key, it is a red flag and the update should be avoided. In addition, commits made to the <a href="https://github.com/DisplaceTech/release-hashes">release hashes repository</a> on GitHub are signed with <a href="https://keybase.io/eamann">Mann&#8217;s PGP key</a> to verify that he is the one who added new code.</p>\n<p>Mann admits that the solution is not fool-proof and is working towards improving it. In future versions, the plugin will only notify the user of a WordPress core update if a digital signature is available. Plugins and themes are on the roadmap as well with the ability to opt-in.</p>\n<p>Although he is the only person allowed to digitally sign packages, the model is not sustainable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I prove out the update system, I’ll also begin adding sets of public keys that are scoped to specific sets of packages,&#8221; Mann said. &#8220;This will, for example, allow me to whitelist a small number of trusted developers to also sign core packages. It might also empower plugin developers to sign their own releases (but not anyone else’s).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mann is seeking feedback and is hoping the project provides evidence that something like it can be added to WordPress core.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 03 Mar 2018 00:56:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"Post Status: Marketing and positioning WordPress products — Draft podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=44157";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"https://poststatus.com/marketing-positioning-wordpress-products-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2776:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Without it, users will experience unnecessary frustration and hamper enthusiasm of the new editor. In an effort to figure out what plugins are already compatible with Gutenberg, Daniel Bachhuber <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/03/01/introducing-the-gutenberg-plugin-compatibility-database/">has created</a> a <a href="https://plugincompat.danielbachhuber.com/">Gutenberg Plugin Compatibility Database</a>.</p>\n<img />Gutenberg Plugin Compatibility Database\n<p>The database contains 5,000 plugins that represent more than 90% of the total active install count. Plugins are compatible with Gutenberg if they meet the following two requirements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A WordPress user can perform the same functional task with Gutenberg active. For instance, if the plugin includes an &#8216;Add Media&#8217; button, it&#8217;s considered Gutenberg-compatible when it has a block registered for the Gutenberg inserter.</li>\n<li>There are no (obvious) errors when the WordPress plugin is active alongside Gutenberg.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to participate in the testing process, you&#8217;ll need to <a href="https://plugincompat.danielbachhuber.com/#account-details/">register an account</a> on the site. Once approved, testers will be able to create a fresh sandboxed WordPress install on the site and test randomly selected plugins. After a manual review is complete, plugins will be marked as <code>is_compatible=yes</code> or <code>is_compatible=no</code>.</p>\n<p>Some plugins are already classified with <code>is_compatible=likely_yes</code> or <code>is_compatible=likely_</code>. As reports are completed, two pie charts that display compatibility results at the bottom of the site update automatically.</p>\n<p>Bachhuber estimates that if each plugin takes about a minute to test, they&#8217;ll need roughly 75 person-hours to get through the remaining 4,500 plugins in the database. This project is a great opportunity for individuals and businesses to contribute back to WordPress via the <a href="https://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/">Five for The Future initiative</a>.</p>\n<p>Ideal testers are those who can review dozens of plugins, but even reviewing a few will help the project.

To remedy this issue, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordpress-4-9-4-maintenance-release/">version 4.9.4 was released</a> the following day requiring many people to manually update their sites.</p>\n\n<p>While this kind of issue is always regrettable, the good thing is that it was fixed quickly, and that not all sites had updated to 4.9.3 yet, which meant they bypassed the bug in that version.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more technical information about this issue <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/06/wordpress-4-9-4-release-the-technical-details/">on the Core development blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The WordCamp Incubator is Back</h2>\n\n<p>In 2016, the Global Community Team ran an experimental program to help spread WordPress to underserved areas by providing more significant organizing support for their first WordCamp event. This program was dubbed the WordCamp Incubator, and it was so successful in the three cities where it ran that <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordcamp-incubator-2-0/">the program is back for 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the Community Team is looking for cities to be a part of this year’s incubator by <a href="https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-city-application">taking applications</a>. Additionally, each incubator community will need an experienced WordCamp organizer to assist them as a co-lead organizer for their event — if that sounds interesting to you, then you can <a href="https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-co-lead-application">fill in the application form for co-leads</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out further information about the WordCamp Incubator <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/19/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-announcement/">on the Community Team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordPress Meetup Roundtables scheduled for March</h2>\n\n<p>In order to assist local WordPress meetup organizers with running their meetup groups, some members of the Community Team have organized <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/23/wordpress-meetup-roundtables-scheduled-for-march/">weekly meetup roundtable discussions through the month of March</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These will be run as video chats at 16:00 UTC every Wednesday this month and will be a great place for meetup organizers to come together and help each other out with practical ideas and advice.</p>\n\n<p>If you are not already in the WordPress meetup program and would like to join, you can find out more information in <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/">the WordPress Meetup Organizer Handbook</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>GDPR Compliance in WordPress Core</h2>\n\n<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an upcoming regulation that will affect all online services across Europe. In order to prepare for this, a working group has been formed to make sure that WordPress is compliant with the GDPR regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the fact that this will be a requirement for the project going forward, it will also have an important and significant impact on the privacy and security of WordPress as a whole. The working group has posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/19/proposed-roadmap-tools-for-gdpr-compliance/">their proposed roadmap</a> for this project and it looks very promising.</p>\n\n<p>To get involved in building WordPress Core, jump into the #gdpr-compliance channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>WPShout published <a href="https://wpshout.com/complete-guide-wordpress-security/">a thorough guide to WordPress security</a>.</li>\n    <li>The Community Team has published interesting statistics from the WordCamp program in <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/27/wordcamps-in-2016/">2016</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/28/wordcamps-in-2017/">2017</a>.</li>\n    <li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/15/potential-addition-of-a-new-onboarding-team/">An intriguing proposal has been made</a> for a new ‘Onboarding’ team to be started in the WordPress project.</li>\n    <li>The new editing experience for WordPress, named Gutenberg, continues to be actively developed with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/16/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16th-february/">a feature-packed release</a> this past month.</li>\n    <li>The Advanced WordPress Facebook group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vS_jR5-nIo">held an interview with WordPress co-founder, Matt Mullenweg</a> about the Gutenberg project.</li>\n    <li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2018/02/27/two-factor-authentication-on-wp-org/">Two factor authentication is on its way to the WordPress.org network</a> — this will be a great improvement to the overall security of the project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/">submit it here</a>.</em></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 01 Mar 2018 08:41:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Hugh Lashbrooke";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 306 – AMP, GDPR, and Brewing Beer At The Boss’ House";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=78185&preview=true&preview_id=78185";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-306-amp-gdpr-and-brewing-beer-at-the-boss-house";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1707:"<p>In this episode, <a href="http://jjj.me">John James Jacoby</a> joins me live from Hutchinson, KS, to talk about the news of the week.

We came up with some changes that feel deeply satisfying. Changes we think should help HeroPress, help readers, and help us as content producers. So here we go.</p>\n<h3>Financial Changes</h3>\n<p>At various times in the past people have told me that the time I spend on HeroPress is worth compensation. When I first started it as a blog, I had no intention of getting money from it. However, being compensated for my time helped ease the burden on my family.</p>\n<blockquote><p>With that in mind, last fall I test-drove a donation page based on interest from some in the community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was a good idea, and I’m thankful for the support I received, but for now it’s not the right path.</p>\n<p>So, I’ve pulled the donation page from the site and am no longer accepting site sponsors. You’ll notice I do have a Sponsorship page, but it lists organizations that have made material contributions like hosting, plugins, etc.</p>\n<h3>Content Changes</h3>\n<p>We’ve been publishing every Wednesday for several years now. Over time, readership has climbed quite a bit. That’s great, but it means that many current readers have never seen the earlier content, which remains quite evergreen.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To address this, we’re going to do new HeroPress essays once a month. The other weeks of the month will be replays of earlier essays.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This allows for some breathing room in gathering new contributors and brings back some really great content that shouldn’t be forgotten.</p>\n<p>It also opens up my time to explore the community more. To see if there are new ways that people, particularly on the fringe, can be helped. Sharing stories is useful, but are there other opportunities and needs we’re missing?</p>\n<h3>The Future</h3>\n<p>So HeroPress will continue. I still love doing it. At various times we’ve discussed making it bigger, doing grand things. But not now. For now we’re going to let it grow organically and continue letting it serve its purpose: to give voice to WordPress stories, to make them known, to inspire.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Changes Coming To HeroPress" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Changes%20Coming%20To%20HeroPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fchanges-coming-heropress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Changes Coming To HeroPress" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fchanges-coming-heropress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fchanges-coming-heropress%2F&title=Changes+Coming+To+HeroPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Changes Coming To HeroPress"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/changes-coming-heropress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/plugins/rtsocial/images/default-pinterest.png&description=Changes Coming To HeroPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Changes Coming To HeroPress"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/changes-coming-heropress/" title="Changes Coming To HeroPress"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/changes-coming-heropress/">Changes Coming To HeroPress</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 12:00:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"WPTavern: New Team Forms to Facilitate GDPR Compliance in WordPress Core";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=78149";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"https://wptavern.com/new-team-forms-to-facilitate-gdpr-compliance-in-wordpress-core";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6200:"<p>As May 25th, the enforcement date for the <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) draws near, individuals and businesses are scrambling to make sure they&#8217;re compliant. I&#8217;ve read a number of blog posts throughout the WordPress community explaining the GDPR and what needs to be done for compliance and it&#8217;s a tough thing to grasp.</p>\n<p>The EU GDPR was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, protect and empower European citizens data privacy, and reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. In reading the regulation and various blog posts, the terminology makes it appear that the changes are geared towards large, international businesses that process personal data.</p>\n<p>However, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/gdpr-for-web-developers/">according to Heather Burns</a>, a digital law specialist in Glasgow, Scotland, the GDPR affects sites large and small.</p>\n<blockquote><p>GDPR applies to all businesses, organizations, sectors, situations, and scenarios, regardless of a business’s size, head count, or financial turnover. A small app studio is every bit as beholden to these rules as a large corporation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Determining if your site needs to be compliant and how to accomplish it can be overwhelming. If you do business in Europe or collect data from European users, you must protect that data in accordance with the GDPR as if you were in Europe. For example, if you operate a blog with a contact form that saves entries to the database from people who live in Europe, you must make your site GDPR compliant.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of aspects to the GDPR and while an excerpt can not fully explain it at a glance, there are a few themes that stick out to me.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be upfront and concise about what data is stored, sent, and used on the site or form.</li>\n<li>Give the user a chance to consent without automatically opting them in.</li>\n<li>Collect the least amount of data possible for legitimate business purposes.</li>\n<li>Provide a way for users to download or access their data and remove it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many of these are common sense practices that are not implemented on many sites, WP Tavern included. How often do you visit a <a href="https://wptavern.com/contact-me">site&#8217;s contact form</a> and see an explanation as to why those fields are required, where the data is stored, where it goes, and what is done with it? This is something I&#8217;ll be working on in the next few weeks.</p>\n<h2>Making WordPress Core GDPR Compliant</h2>\n<p>Earlier <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/13/gdpr-compliance-agenda-february-14/">this month</a>, a number of volunteers gathered to discuss GDPR compliance in WordPress core. The meeting took place in a newly created channel #gdpr-compliance that&#8217;s accessible to anyone with a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">SlackHQ account</a>.</p>\n<p>The team created a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/19/proposed-roadmap-tools-for-gdpr-compliance/">proposed roadmap</a> to add privacy tools to core. The plan includes the following ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add notices for registered users and commenters on what data is collected in core by default and explain why.</li>\n<li>Create guidelines for plugins on how to become GDPR compliant.</li>\n<li>Create and add tools to facilitate compliance and privacy in general.</li>\n<li>Add documentation and help for site owners to learn how to use these tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C9695RJBW/p1519227959000760">Earlier today</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/27/gdpr-compliance-chat-recap-february-21st/">the team met</a> and created a <a href="https://github.com/gdpr-compliance/info">GitHub folder</a> that houses the roadmap, knowledge base, trac ticket list, and other items associated with the project. There was also some discussion on whether the interface provided by the <a href="https://www.gdprwp.com/">GDPR for WordPress project</a> is a good foundation for core and plugins to report personal data. The GDPR Compliance Slack channel is also a good place to ask questions and discuss data privacy in general.</p>\n<p>Popular form plugins such as <a href="https://docs.gravityforms.com/wordpress-gravity-forms-and-gdpr-compliance/">GravityForms</a> and <a href="https://ninjaforms.com/gdpr-compliance-wordpress-forms/">NinjaForms</a> have documentation available that explains GDPR compliance and how it applies to their products. For those who use the Contact Form module in Jetpack which <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/8430">saves entries to the database by default</a>, you&#8217;ll need to wait for further updates. <a href="https://woocommerce.com/2017/12/gdpr-compliance-woocommerce/">WooCommerce</a> and <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/automattic-gdpr/">Automattic</a> have announced that they expect their products will be GDPR compliant by the time it goes into effect later this year.</p>\n<h2>GDPR Resources</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re like me, reading about the GDPR and its policies can make your head spin. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that at the heart of the GDPR are common sense behaviors for handling personal data.

The interview concludes the <a href="http://www.advancedwp.org/awp-gutenberg-interview-series/">Advanced WordPress Gutenberg interview series</a> that includes, <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2018/02/06/awp-gutenberg-interview-series-with-joost-de-valk/">Joost de Valk</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2018/02/18/awp-gutenberg-interview-series-with-ahmad-awais/">Ahmad Awais</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/ic_du_lsbLE">Tammie Lister</a>.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg began the session by explaining why there is a concerted effort to improve the editor. &#8220;It&#8217;s really almost any user test that you watch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Both watching people brand new to WordPress and those with years of experience on how they used the editor. It became obvious that we could make something more accessible to new users, but also, a lot more powerful for developers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With regards to a release date, Mullenweg confirmed that Gutenberg will ship when it&#8217;s ready. Later in the interview, Mullenweg was asked if he could provide a more concrete answer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For those who want a concrete date, we will have one or two orders of magnitude more users of Gutenberg in April,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean necessarily a 5.0 release, but it does mean that if you&#8217;re planning on aiming for something where a lot of users will be interacting with Gutenberg, aim for April.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While the project&#8217;s name is Gutenberg, some developers have <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4681">expressed concerns</a> on how the name will be deprecated if at all once it&#8217;s merged into core. There are a number of educational resources, products, and tool kits referencing Gutenberg that could be a source of confusion once it&#8217;s merged into core and referred to as the editor.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg was asked if the Gutenberg name will be deprecated. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the most important thing to figure out right now. We&#8217;re tackling some much bigger issues. If the plugin is useful, we&#8217;ll keep it around for beta testing, if not, we&#8217;ll have it turn itself off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg concluded the interview thanking the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/">Advanced WordPress Facebook</a> group for the passion and discussions shared by members. The group has more than 30K members, is free to join, well maintained, and often filled with interesting topics.

They spend the rest of their days sprawled out on our wooden floors in a way that honestly makes them look pretty dead.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut there’s a big difference between dogs who enjoy snoozing in a patch of sunlight after a long day of sprints and ones who are consistently lethargic. Not sure which camp your dog lies in? Let’s take a look.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Signs of lethargy</em> in dogs include napping way more than usual and a diminished interest in eating or drinking. Lethargic dogs can also have delayed responses to external stimuli, like someone calling their name or tossing them a tennis ball. In other words, dogs get dazed and confused, too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour dog might be lethargic after a particularly long day and can perk back up in as little as 24 hours, but if you notice signs of lethargy for days at a time, you might want to consider other causes. Like in humans, lethargy in dogs can be caused by both physical and mental issues like <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/causes-of-dog-diarrhea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diarrhea</a>, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>, and infection, as well as <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> and depression. When coupled with any of these ailments, lethargy is a sign that it’s time to see the vet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are at-home ways to improve your dog’s energy levels, too. An <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improperly balanced</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly processed</a> diet can lead to the same sluggish feelings of lethargy you experience after eating pasta for three days straight. Consider adding fresh foods like  <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vegetables </a>(or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/sardines-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sardines</a> if you’re feeling creative) to your dog’s bowl for a boost of nutrients and energy. Research shows that fresh food can help build strong immunity and increase vitality in dogs, so you can also switch your pup to a regular diet of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real, unprocessed food</a> to kick that 3pm slump for good.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA Saturday in bed is necessary every once in a while, but we all know fitness is in and the same goes for your dog. Adding extra <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercise to your dog’s routine</a> can help balance energy levels and give you both a little more pep in your step. What you do with that energy (like, say, sprinting down hallways until you pass out) is up to you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a class="_2g7d5 notranslate _iadoq" title="theobonaparte" href="https://www.instagram.com/theobonaparte/">@theobonaparte</a></em>', 'Why is my dog so lethargic?', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'why-is-my-dog-so-lethargic__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:26:54', '2018-04-10 14:26:54', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=30', 0, 'post', '', 0),

In addition to the emotional distress that Halloween can cause, that bowl of candy by the front door is also treacherous for any pet. Keep your dog away from these tricks in the treat bucket this Halloween.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Chocolate</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhether or not you have kids, chocolate is bound to make its way into your house this Halloween. Most dog owners are already aware of the dangers of chocolate for dogs, but here’s a quick refresher. The villain is a molecule found in chocolate known as <em>theobromine,</em> which is very difficult for dogs to digest. Not all chocolate is equally poisonous; dark chocolate contains more than six times the amount of the deadly molecule than milk chocolate, which means those Kit Kat Halloween Darkness candies are especially spooky. Smaller dogs are at a greater risk of getting sick than bigger breeds, and symptoms include vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, and increased heart rate. If ingested in large quantities, this sinister treat can lead to death, so keep that candy bowl far out of reach.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Garlic</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGarlic is a key weapon in the fight against vampires, but it can also have adverse effects on your dog’s health. Garlic contains thiosulfate which damages red blood cells and can cause anemia. This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Raisins</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Candy</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach. Instead of chocolate or candy, chop up some <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh treats</a> for your dog to enjoy, like apples or carrots. They may not be as decadent as your treats, but your dog’s health is a far better investment. Someone needs to be around to keep you safe during those scary movies.\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/">@butterandwilson</a></em>', 'Keep your dog safe from these tricks in halloween treats', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'keep-your-dog-safe-from-these-tricks-in-halloween-treats__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:28:29', '2018-04-10 14:28:29', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=34', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\r\n<h5><strong>Why do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. teeth, nails, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>Grooming by coat type</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog? Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome dogs also have an undercoat, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How does your dog’s diet affect coat health?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair. The important ones here are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (both of which you can find in superfoods like olive oil!). Omega-3s help to reduce general inflammation, which can cut down on dander and combat any bites or allergies, while omega-6s stimulate hair growth. A healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids ultimately results in a strong and lustrous coat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you think your dog might have an omega-3 or omega-6 deficiency, you can supplement his diet with fish or flaxseed oil or switch to a fresh, balanced meal plan. If you’re home cooking for your dog or supplementing yourself, check in with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure that you’re feeding a balanced diet. Brushing, bathing, and feeding your dog right? Get ready for hair so healthy, it shines.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nImage: @thedogphotobooth', 'How to keep your dog\'s skin and coat healthy', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-to-keep-your-dogs-skin-and-coat-healthy__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:29:19', '2018-04-10 14:29:19', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=38', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Lethargic dogs can also have delayed responses to external stimuli, like someone calling their name or tossing them a tennis ball. In other words, dogs get dazed and confused, too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour dog might be lethargic after a particularly long day and can perk back up in as little as 24 hours, but if you notice signs of lethargy for days at a time, you might want to consider other causes. Like in humans, lethargy in dogs can be caused by both physical and mental issues like <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/causes-of-dog-diarrhea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diarrhea</a>, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>, and infection, as well as <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> and depression. When coupled with any of these ailments, lethargy is a sign that it’s time to see the vet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are at-home ways to improve your dog’s energy levels, too. An <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improperly balanced</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly processed</a> diet can lead to the same sluggish feelings of lethargy you experience after eating pasta for three days straight. Consider adding fresh foods like  <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vegetables </a>(or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/sardines-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sardines</a> if you’re feeling creative) to your dog’s bowl for a boost of nutrients and energy. Research shows that fresh food can help build strong immunity and increase vitality in dogs, so you can also switch your pup to a regular diet of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real, unprocessed food</a> to kick that 3pm slump for good.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA Saturday in bed is necessary every once in a while, but we all know fitness is in and the same goes for your dog. Adding extra <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercise to your dog’s routine</a> can help balance energy levels and give you both a little more pep in your step. What you do with that energy (like, say, sprinting down hallways until you pass out) is up to you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a class="_2g7d5 notranslate _iadoq" title="theobonaparte" href="https://www.instagram.com/theobonaparte/">@theobonaparte</a></em>', 'Why is my dog so lethargic?', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'why-is-my-dog-so-lethargic-2__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:26:54', '2018-04-10 14:26:54', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=40', 0, 'post', '', 0),

In addition to the emotional distress that Halloween can cause, that bowl of candy by the front door is also treacherous for any pet. Keep your dog away from these tricks in the treat bucket this Halloween.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Chocolate</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhether or not you have kids, chocolate is bound to make its way into your house this Halloween. Most dog owners are already aware of the dangers of chocolate for dogs, but here’s a quick refresher. The villain is a molecule found in chocolate known as <em>theobromine,</em> which is very difficult for dogs to digest. Not all chocolate is equally poisonous; dark chocolate contains more than six times the amount of the deadly molecule than milk chocolate, which means those Kit Kat Halloween Darkness candies are especially spooky. Smaller dogs are at a greater risk of getting sick than bigger breeds, and symptoms include vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, and increased heart rate. If ingested in large quantities, this sinister treat can lead to death, so keep that candy bowl far out of reach.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Garlic</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGarlic is a key weapon in the fight against vampires, but it can also have adverse effects on your dog’s health. Garlic contains thiosulfate which damages red blood cells and can cause anemia. This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Raisins</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Candy</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach. Instead of chocolate or candy, chop up some <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh treats</a> for your dog to enjoy, like apples or carrots. They may not be as decadent as your treats, but your dog’s health is a far better investment. Someone needs to be around to keep you safe during those scary movies.\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/">@butterandwilson</a></em>', 'Keep your dog safe from these tricks in halloween treats', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'keep-your-dog-safe-from-these-tricks-in-halloween-treats-2__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:28:29', '2018-04-10 14:28:29', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=43', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\r\n<h5><strong>Why do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. teeth, nails, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>Grooming by coat type</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog? Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome dogs also have an undercoat, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How does your dog’s diet affect coat health?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair. The important ones here are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (both of which you can find in superfoods like olive oil!). Omega-3s help to reduce general inflammation, which can cut down on dander and combat any bites or allergies, while omega-6s stimulate hair growth. A healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids ultimately results in a strong and lustrous coat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you think your dog might have an omega-3 or omega-6 deficiency, you can supplement his diet with fish or flaxseed oil or switch to a fresh, balanced meal plan. If you’re home cooking for your dog or supplementing yourself, check in with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure that you’re feeding a balanced diet. Brushing, bathing, and feeding your dog right? Get ready for hair so healthy, it shines.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nImage: @thedogphotobooth', 'How to keep your dog’s skin and coat healthy', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-to-keep-your-dogs-skin-and-coat-healthy-2__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:29:20', '2018-04-10 14:29:20', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=45', 0, 'post', '', 0),

We feel deeply bonded to the four-legged creatures we share our lives with and often treat them like real children (minus the <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chocolate turkey</a> center pieces). But do our dogs reciprocate our familial feels? This Thanksgiving, we’re digging into the concept of family as it pertains to our pups.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Do dogs recognize their own canine family members?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTechnically, yes. Research shows that dogs exhibit recognition for both their littermates and biological mothers. In one study, 5-week-old puppies were released into a room with wire enclosures on either side. One side housed the puppies’ mothers and littermates, while the other housed random puppies and adult female dogs. In both instances, the puppies were significantly more likely to walk over to the side of the room with their relatives than the side with strangers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nResearchers hypothesized that these results were based on scent cues, and went on to successfully test this theory by repeating the study using towels with each dog’s scent instead of the dogs themselves. The results were nearly identical. Taking it one step further, they repeated the study with 2-year-old-dogs who hadn’t seen their mothers since they were 8 weeks old to see if recognition stood the test of time. Both mothers and puppies recognized each other more than 75% of the time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese findings may seem heartwarming, but recognition doesn’t necessarily mean that dogs miss or yearn for their relatives when they’re apart. Rather, these studies prove more about the link between recognition and scent cues than an awareness of familial bonds. So yes, dogs recognize their canine relatives. But do they feel the same kind of love for their mothers that we feel for them?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do dogs relate to their human families?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere’s actually an encouraging difference between the way dogs recognize familiar dogs and  familiar humans. Scent still drives this type of recognition, but dogs don’t just see humans as another member of their pack.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn one study, a reward response was evoked in the brains of dogs who recognized the scent of a familiar human. This is a completely different response than the one triggered by recognizing another dog. (See: the way your dog acts on the sidewalk, pulling you in the direction of random dogs, while remaining disinterested in passing humans.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn other words, dogs know that humans aren’t<em> </em>like them, but they reserve a special part of their brains for the love and companionship we can provide. They’re not about to flash those <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/puppy-dog-eyes-feel-guilt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puppy eyes</a> at another dog, because they know dogs can’t provide kisses, belly rubs, or bowls of <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delicious food.</a> They love their caretakers because we help them meet fundamental needs they can’t satisfy on their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo this Thanksgiving, while you’re relishing the smell of home (aka butter) with your family, remember: your pup is also forming scent memories. They just have less to do with turkey and more to do with loving you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gralizzybear/">@gralizzybear</a></em>', 'What family really means to your dog', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'what-family-really-means-to-your-dog__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:26:56', '2018-04-10 14:26:56', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=48', 0, 'post', '', 0),

I majored in English.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDon’t believe me? Over the next few months we’ll be interviewing people from a variety of cities and industries about how bringing their working dogs to the office has impacted their lives, careers, and mental health. But first, a word from science.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Benefits of dogs in the workplace:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dogs make everything better. Even Excel spreadsheets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2. Happier employees = more productive employees.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3. Having a dog-friendly workplace creates a welcoming and warm energy, which can help with team building and recruiting. Allowing employees to bring their dogs to work also cuts the potential cost of dog walkers and daycare from their budgets, enabling them to save money five days a week.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n4. On a similar note, letting employees bring dogs to work removes the stress of tight time constraints — there’s less pressure to run home to feed or walk the dog at the end of the day. One 2008 survey of both small and big companies showed that dog-friendly offices had employees who were willing to work longer hours as well as lower rates of employee absenteeism. Employees working alongside their dogs are more inclined to stick around, finish work without feeling rushed, and go home when they’re ready.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n5. Like I said before, this is all backed by #science. <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/study-office-dogs-reduce-work-related-stress.html">A 2012 study</a> from Virginia Commonwealth University found that employees surrounded by dogs in the workplace were less stressed than those who left their pets at home. Randolph Barker, a leader on <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/17538351211215366">the VCU study</a> published in the International Journal of Workplace Health Management, described the outcome as a “low cost wellness benefit.” (I’m nailing economic theory right now.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n6. In the same study, researchers found that employees with in-office dogs reported higher productivity. Both of these benefits might be attributed to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone that decreases stress in the human body. Oxytocin, also known as the “cuddle hormone,” is released when bonding socially, snuggling, or petting and interacting with animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n7. Dogs foster a more collaborative work environment. Who needs a water cooler when you can gather ‘round a dog? Meet your cute new co-worker over a petting sesh. Everyone bonds over belly rubs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n8. Walking, feeding, or playing with a dog is a nice way to <a href="https://www.inc.com/jordan-smith/companies-find-stress-reducing-benefits-of-office-dogs.html">break up your work day</a>. We already know that sitting at a desk for nine hours isn’t great for your health. Taking a walk around the block (or even just to the treats jar at the front of the office) with your pup is an incentive to get moving in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHave a working dog who makes office life better?

Therapy dogs go a step even further, as they can help improve a host of mental and physical ailments. Here is a closer look at what therapy dogs do, the science behind their efficacy, and the steps you can take to get <em>your</em> pup certified.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What is a therapy dog?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor starters, a therapy dog is not the same thing as a service dog (it’s also not a dog with a prescription pad and PhD). A service dog is trained to provide assistance to someone with a specific disability such as blindness, epilepsy, or PTSD.

I still remember jumping in the car and going to search for him, hoping he hadn’t been hurt. Luckily he survived his many adventures, but not all dogs are as fortunate.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHaving a dog go missing is an emotional and challenging experience, but by understanding the many reasons why dogs run away, we can learn to correct and prevent it. Below are a few reasons why your pup might be engaging in this type of behavior, plus tips on how to handle his urge to roam. As always, you should consult with a certified dog trainer to figure out the best approach for your dog’s specific needs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Mating</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDogs have a natural instinct to find a mate. Unaltered female dogs produce a very specific scent when they’re in heat, and intact male dogs will often wander off in order to find them. This is an easy “fix;” getting your dog spayed or neutered will not only stop your pet from wandering away, but also help keep the pet population under control. You can find low-cost clinics in your area <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/low-cost-spayneuter-programs">here</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Boredom</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDogs are social creatures and need regular interaction and mental stimulation to be truly content. If they aren’t getting enough <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activity</a> at home, they’ll eventually take it upon themselves to find some elsewhere. Make sure your pup’s environment is stimulating and that you are spending enough playing and <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/decoding-dog-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interacting with him</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Fear</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStorms, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/save-your-dog-from-summertime-sadness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireworks</a>, and loud noises can all trigger fear in your dog and are potential reasons why he may run off. If your dog is consistently <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">afraid of certain situations</a>, consult your vet for the best course of treatment. Designate a safe, quiet area for your dog or consider medication if your pup needs extra assistance staying calm during especially nerve wracking events.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>New Surroundings</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMoving is chaotic enough without having to account for another being’s emotional state, but don’t forget to consider your pup. It’s challenging for dogs to understand the concept of a new, permanent home and they may try to run back to their old familiar digs. If possible, unpack familiar items first and let your pup acclimate to his new environment slowly. After a bit of time, patience, and plenty of love, he will come to understand that this is his new home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Bad Habits</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe often don’t know a dog’s full history when we adopt and bring him home. If he was able to roam spontaneously before and that freedom has now been taken away, it might be hard for him to learn the new rules. It will take some training and positive reinforcement to correct this kind of behavior, so working with a trainer is recommended.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Excitement</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust like little kids running after an ice cream truck, dogs can get easily excited by new distractions and forget their training. Squirrels, other dogs, and cats can all be tempting to chase after. My Labrador, for instance, would often run to construction sites to find workers who would gladly share their lunches with him. To correct this, make sure your dog is leashed while on walks or that your yard is secured.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Opportunity</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog digs under the fence or bolts out the front door when it’s open, it may be time to invest in some new systems. Put stones under the fence and always put his leash on before anyone opens the front door.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNo matter how well you think you know your dog’s behavioral tendencies, it’s important that all dogs are microchipped and always wearing tags. In the unfortunate event that your dog roams a little too far, these precautions will help ensure that whoever locates him can get him back to you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog has gone missing, let local police, shelters, and animal control know right away. You may also want to reach out to local vets, groomers, pet stores, and animal hospitals. Send them a current picture of your pup along with your contact information and the best way to reach you. A community of pet lovers working together has a greater chance of helping reunite you and your best friend.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/therescuerunway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@therescuerunway </a></em>', 'How to keep your dog from running away', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-to-keep-your-dog-from-running-away__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:29:18', '2018-04-10 14:29:18', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=55', 0, 'post', '', 0),

We feel deeply bonded to the four-legged creatures we share our lives with and often treat them like real children (minus the <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chocolate turkey</a> center pieces). But do our dogs reciprocate our familial feels? This Thanksgiving, we’re digging into the concept of family as it pertains to our pups.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Do dogs recognize their own canine family members?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTechnically, yes. Research shows that dogs exhibit recognition for both their littermates and biological mothers. In one study, 5-week-old puppies were released into a room with wire enclosures on either side. One side housed the puppies’ mothers and littermates, while the other housed random puppies and adult female dogs. In both instances, the puppies were significantly more likely to walk over to the side of the room with their relatives than the side with strangers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nResearchers hypothesized that these results were based on scent cues, and went on to successfully test this theory by repeating the study using towels with each dog’s scent instead of the dogs themselves. The results were nearly identical. Taking it one step further, they repeated the study with 2-year-old-dogs who hadn’t seen their mothers since they were 8 weeks old to see if recognition stood the test of time. Both mothers and puppies recognized each other more than 75% of the time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese findings may seem heartwarming, but recognition doesn’t necessarily mean that dogs miss or yearn for their relatives when they’re apart. Rather, these studies prove more about the link between recognition and scent cues than an awareness of familial bonds. So yes, dogs recognize their canine relatives. But do they feel the same kind of love for their mothers that we feel for them?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do dogs relate to their human families?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere’s actually an encouraging difference between the way dogs recognize familiar dogs and  familiar humans. Scent still drives this type of recognition, but dogs don’t just see humans as another member of their pack.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn one study, a reward response was evoked in the brains of dogs who recognized the scent of a familiar human. This is a completely different response than the one triggered by recognizing another dog. (See: the way your dog acts on the sidewalk, pulling you in the direction of random dogs, while remaining disinterested in passing humans.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn other words, dogs know that humans aren’t<em> </em>like them, but they reserve a special part of their brains for the love and companionship we can provide. They’re not about to flash those <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/puppy-dog-eyes-feel-guilt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puppy eyes</a> at another dog, because they know dogs can’t provide kisses, belly rubs, or bowls of <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delicious food.</a> They love their caretakers because we help them meet fundamental needs they can’t satisfy on their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo this Thanksgiving, while you’re relishing the smell of home (aka butter) with your family, remember: your pup is also forming scent memories. They just have less to do with turkey and more to do with loving you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gralizzybear/">@gralizzybear</a></em>', 'What family really means to your dog', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'what-family-really-means-to-your-dog-2__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:26:56', '2018-04-10 14:26:56', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=57', 0, 'post', '', 0),

I majored in English.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDon’t believe me? Over the next few months we’ll be interviewing people from a variety of cities and industries about how bringing their working dogs to the office has impacted their lives, careers, and mental health. But first, a word from science.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Benefits of dogs in the workplace:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dogs make everything better. Even Excel spreadsheets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2. Happier employees = more productive employees.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3. Having a dog-friendly workplace creates a welcoming and warm energy, which can help with team building and recruiting. Allowing employees to bring their dogs to work also cuts the potential cost of dog walkers and daycare from their budgets, enabling them to save money five days a week.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n4. On a similar note, letting employees bring dogs to work removes the stress of tight time constraints — there’s less pressure to run home to feed or walk the dog at the end of the day. One 2008 survey of both small and big companies showed that dog-friendly offices had employees who were willing to work longer hours as well as lower rates of employee absenteeism. Employees working alongside their dogs are more inclined to stick around, finish work without feeling rushed, and go home when they’re ready.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n5. Like I said before, this is all backed by #science. <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/study-office-dogs-reduce-work-related-stress.html">A 2012 study</a> from Virginia Commonwealth University found that employees surrounded by dogs in the workplace were less stressed than those who left their pets at home. Randolph Barker, a leader on <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/17538351211215366">the VCU study</a> published in the International Journal of Workplace Health Management, described the outcome as a “low cost wellness benefit.” (I’m nailing economic theory right now.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n6. In the same study, researchers found that employees with in-office dogs reported higher productivity. Both of these benefits might be attributed to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone that decreases stress in the human body. Oxytocin, also known as the “cuddle hormone,” is released when bonding socially, snuggling, or petting and interacting with animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n7. Dogs foster a more collaborative work environment. Who needs a water cooler when you can gather ‘round a dog? Meet your cute new co-worker over a petting sesh. Everyone bonds over belly rubs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n8. Walking, feeding, or playing with a dog is a nice way to <a href="https://www.inc.com/jordan-smith/companies-find-stress-reducing-benefits-of-office-dogs.html">break up your work day</a>. We already know that sitting at a desk for nine hours isn’t great for your health. Taking a walk around the block (or even just to the treats jar at the front of the office) with your pup is an incentive to get moving in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHave a working dog who makes office life better?

A service dog is trained to provide assistance to someone with a specific disability such as blindness, epilepsy, or PTSD. This is essentially a full-time job for that dog, as his owner is usually the person for whom he provides this particular service.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA therapy dog needs training as well, but it tends to be more generalized and temperament-centric than, say, the very specific way a service dog is trained to protect his owner’s head during a seizure.

It’s a lot like that, on a more institutional level.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What is the science behind therapy dogs?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn addition to their winning combination of loyalty and fluffiness, dogs have been scientifically shown to make <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/5-ways-your-dog-is-making-you-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans healthier.</a> Therapy dogs in particular are proven to:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Reduce blood pressure\r\n</strong>High blood pressure (or hypertension) is a major risk for heart disease and stroke, so reduced blood pressure is tremendously important. Patients in assisted living facilities or hospitals may see lower blood pressure levels after spending extended periods of time petting a dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Increase both endorphins and oxytocin\r\n</strong>Endorphins are essentially a naturally occurring form of morphine, inducing a little jolt of euphoria when activated (think: the high you feel after going on a long run). Oxytocin is also a very powerful hormone – often called “the love hormone” – and gets triggered when you hug or kiss a loved one (or see a friendly tail wagging your way). It’s also believed to be the chemical backbone that underlies the feeling of trust.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lower cortisol levels\r\n</strong>Cortisol is a steroid hormone released in response to stress, and it mostly works to increase blood sugar and assist in the metabolism of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Things like massage therapy and laughter <em>lower</em> cortisol levels, while caffeine, sleep deprivation, and severe trauma <em>increase</em> them. Which category would you rather fall into?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOf course, not <em>every</em> dog has the temperament to be a therapy dog.

Is your dog naturally calm and friendly around strangers? Do crowds, loud noises, and sudden movements give him anxiety? Has he received (and excelled in) at least basic obedience training?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf the answer to all of the above is yes, then congratulations! You’re on your way to becoming a dynamic therapy duo (you, as the handler, are an important part of this equation too). To become a licensed therapy dog, you and your pup will need to pass a test and get certified by an official registry.

If they aren’t getting enough <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activity</a> at home, they’ll eventually take it upon themselves to find some elsewhere.

If your dog is consistently <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">afraid of certain situations</a>, consult your vet for the best course of treatment. Designate a safe, quiet area for your dog or consider medication if your pup needs extra assistance staying calm during especially nerve wracking events.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>New Surroundings</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMoving is chaotic enough without having to account for another being’s emotional state, but don’t forget to consider your pup. It’s challenging for dogs to understand the concept of a new, permanent home and they may try to run back to their old familiar digs. If possible, unpack familiar items first and let your pup acclimate to his new environment slowly. After a bit of time, patience, and plenty of love, he will come to understand that this is his new home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Bad Habits</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe often don’t know a dog’s full history when we adopt and bring him home. If he was able to roam spontaneously before and that freedom has now been taken away, it might be hard for him to learn the new rules. It will take some training and positive reinforcement to correct this kind of behavior, so working with a trainer is recommended.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Excitement</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust like little kids running after an ice cream truck, dogs can get easily excited by new distractions and forget their training. Squirrels, other dogs, and cats can all be tempting to chase after. My Labrador, for instance, would often run to construction sites to find workers who would gladly share their lunches with him. To correct this, make sure your dog is leashed while on walks or that your yard is secured.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Opportunity</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog digs under the fence or bolts out the front door when it’s open, it may be time to invest in some new systems. Put stones under the fence and always put his leash on before anyone opens the front door.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNo matter how well you think you know your dog’s behavioral tendencies, it’s important that all dogs are microchipped and always wearing tags. In the unfortunate event that your dog roams a little too far, these precautions will help ensure that whoever locates him can get him back to you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog has gone missing, let local police, shelters, and animal control know right away. You may also want to reach out to local vets, groomers, pet stores, and animal hospitals. Send them a current picture of your pup along with your contact information and the best way to reach you.

We feel deeply bonded to the four-legged creatures we share our lives with and often treat them like real children (minus the <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chocolate turkey</a> center pieces). But do our dogs reciprocate our familial feels? This Thanksgiving, we’re digging into the concept of family as it pertains to our pups.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Do dogs recognize their own canine family members?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTechnically, yes. Research shows that dogs exhibit recognition for both their littermates and biological mothers. In one study, 5-week-old puppies were released into a room with wire enclosures on either side. One side housed the puppies’ mothers and littermates, while the other housed random puppies and adult female dogs. In both instances, the puppies were significantly more likely to walk over to the side of the room with their relatives than the side with strangers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nResearchers hypothesized that these results were based on scent cues, and went on to successfully test this theory by repeating the study using towels with each dog’s scent instead of the dogs themselves. The results were nearly identical. Taking it one step further, they repeated the study with 2-year-old-dogs who hadn’t seen their mothers since they were 8 weeks old to see if recognition stood the test of time. Both mothers and puppies recognized each other more than 75% of the time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese findings may seem heartwarming, but recognition doesn’t necessarily mean that dogs miss or yearn for their relatives when they’re apart. Rather, these studies prove more about the link between recognition and scent cues than an awareness of familial bonds. So yes, dogs recognize their canine relatives. But do they feel the same kind of love for their mothers that we feel for them?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do dogs relate to their human families?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere’s actually an encouraging difference between the way dogs recognize familiar dogs and  familiar humans. Scent still drives this type of recognition, but dogs don’t just see humans as another member of their pack.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn one study, a reward response was evoked in the brains of dogs who recognized the scent of a familiar human. This is a completely different response than the one triggered by recognizing another dog. (See: the way your dog acts on the sidewalk, pulling you in the direction of random dogs, while remaining disinterested in passing humans.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn other words, dogs know that humans aren’t<em> </em>like them, but they reserve a special part of their brains for the love and companionship we can provide. They’re not about to flash those <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/puppy-dog-eyes-feel-guilt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puppy eyes</a> at another dog, because they know dogs can’t provide kisses, belly rubs, or bowls of <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delicious food.</a> They love their caretakers because we help them meet fundamental needs they can’t satisfy on their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo this Thanksgiving, while you’re relishing the smell of home (aka butter) with your family, remember: your pup is also forming scent memories. They just have less to do with turkey and more to do with loving you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gralizzybear/">@gralizzybear</a></em>', 'What family really means to your dog', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'what-family-really-means-to-your-dog-3__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:26:56', '2018-04-10 14:26:56', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=66', 0, 'post', '', 0),

I majored in English.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDon’t believe me? Over the next few months we’ll be interviewing people from a variety of cities and industries about how bringing their working dogs to the office has impacted their lives, careers, and mental health. But first, a word from science.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Benefits of dogs in the workplace:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dogs make everything better. Even Excel spreadsheets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2. Happier employees = more productive employees.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3. Having a dog-friendly workplace creates a welcoming and warm energy, which can help with team building and recruiting. Allowing employees to bring their dogs to work also cuts the potential cost of dog walkers and daycare from their budgets, enabling them to save money five days a week.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n4. On a similar note, letting employees bring dogs to work removes the stress of tight time constraints — there’s less pressure to run home to feed or walk the dog at the end of the day. One 2008 survey of both small and big companies showed that dog-friendly offices had employees who were willing to work longer hours as well as lower rates of employee absenteeism. Employees working alongside their dogs are more inclined to stick around, finish work without feeling rushed, and go home when they’re ready.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n5. Like I said before, this is all backed by #science. <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/study-office-dogs-reduce-work-related-stress.html">A 2012 study</a> from Virginia Commonwealth University found that employees surrounded by dogs in the workplace were less stressed than those who left their pets at home. Randolph Barker, a leader on <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/17538351211215366">the VCU study</a> published in the International Journal of Workplace Health Management, described the outcome as a “low cost wellness benefit.” (I’m nailing economic theory right now.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n6. In the same study, researchers found that employees with in-office dogs reported higher productivity. Both of these benefits might be attributed to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone that decreases stress in the human body. Oxytocin, also known as the “cuddle hormone,” is released when bonding socially, snuggling, or petting and interacting with animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n7. Dogs foster a more collaborative work environment. Who needs a water cooler when you can gather ‘round a dog? Meet your cute new co-worker over a petting sesh. Everyone bonds over belly rubs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n8. Walking, feeding, or playing with a dog is a nice way to <a href="https://www.inc.com/jordan-smith/companies-find-stress-reducing-benefits-of-office-dogs.html">break up your work day</a>. We already know that sitting at a desk for nine hours isn’t great for your health. Taking a walk around the block (or even just to the treats jar at the front of the office) with your pup is an incentive to get moving in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHave a working dog who makes office life better?

Therapy dogs go a step even further, as they can help improve a host of mental and physical ailments. Here is a closer look at what therapy dogs do, the science behind their efficacy, and the steps you can take to get <em>your</em> pup certified.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What is a therapy dog?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor starters, a therapy dog is not the same thing as a service dog (it’s also not a dog with a prescription pad and PhD). A service dog is trained to provide assistance to someone with a specific disability such as blindness, epilepsy, or PTSD. This is essentially a full-time job for that dog, as his owner is usually the person for whom he provides this particular service.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA therapy dog needs training as well, but it tends to be more generalized and temperament-centric than, say, the very specific way a service dog is trained to protect his owner’s head during a seizure. Therapy dogs visit hospitals, assisted living facilities, college campuses, and even prisons, and provide love, comfort, and companionship.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou know when you’ve had a bad day at work so you walk by the pet store on your way home and spend 30 minutes watching puppies playing in the window? It’s a lot like that, on a more institutional level.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What is the science behind therapy dogs?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn addition to their winning combination of loyalty and fluffiness, dogs have been scientifically shown to make <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/5-ways-your-dog-is-making-you-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans healthier.</a> Therapy dogs in particular are proven to:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Reduce blood pressure\r\n</strong>High blood pressure (or hypertension) is a major risk for heart disease and stroke, so reduced blood pressure is tremendously important. Patients in assisted living facilities or hospitals may see lower blood pressure levels after spending extended periods of time petting a dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Increase both endorphins and oxytocin\r\n</strong>Endorphins are essentially a naturally occurring form of morphine, inducing a little jolt of euphoria when activated (think: the high you feel after going on a long run). Oxytocin is also a very powerful hormone – often called “the love hormone” – and gets triggered when you hug or kiss a loved one (or see a friendly tail wagging your way). It’s also believed to be the chemical backbone that underlies the feeling of trust.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lower cortisol levels\r\n</strong>Cortisol is a steroid hormone released in response to stress, and it mostly works to increase blood sugar and assist in the metabolism of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Things like massage therapy and laughter <em>lower</em> cortisol levels, while caffeine, sleep deprivation, and severe trauma <em>increase</em> them. Which category would you rather fall into?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOf course, not <em>every</em> dog has the temperament to be a therapy dog. My own dog, for example, has such an <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense fear of strangers</a> that most interactions lead to skyrocketing blood pressures for all parties involved. This, among other reasons, is why he won’t be signing up for therapy duty anytime soon. Think your dog has what it takes?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How can my pup become a therapy dog?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you’re thinking about turning your dog into a charitable super hero, he’ll need to exhibit a few prerequisites. Is your dog naturally calm and friendly around strangers? Do crowds, loud noises, and sudden movements give him anxiety? Has he received (and excelled in) at least basic obedience training?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf the answer to all of the above is yes, then congratulations! You’re on your way to becoming a dynamic therapy duo (you, as the handler, are an important part of this equation too). To become a licensed therapy dog, you and your pup will need to pass a test and get certified by an official registry. Though the specifics of the test will vary between registries, most tests gauge your dog’s ability to sit, stay, walk through a crowd, and respond to other commands.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce you’re registered and ready to go, you can ask your registry for a list or simply reach out to hospitals, nursing homes, or any other group you feel could benefit from quality time with your newly anointed therapy dog. The world is your oyster; some therapy dogs even visit children’s libraries and sit with kids who are learning to read. Your dog’s patient, nonjudgmental gaze can help a child develop the confidence he or she will need to continue improving those reading skills.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou might not be able to heal the world, but your dog’s love and companionship can help brighten it. And if nothing else, it will give him a reason to work for those treats.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gralizzybear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@gralizzybear</a> </em>', 'How your therapy dog can change someone’s life', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-your-therapy-dog-can-change-someones-life-3__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:29:21', '2018-04-10 14:29:21', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=70', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Luckily he survived his many adventures, but not all dogs are as fortunate.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHaving a dog go missing is an emotional and challenging experience, but by understanding the many reasons why dogs run away, we can learn to correct and prevent it. Below are a few reasons why your pup might be engaging in this type of behavior, plus tips on how to handle his urge to roam. As always, you should consult with a certified dog trainer to figure out the best approach for your dog’s specific needs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Mating</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDogs have a natural instinct to find a mate. Unaltered female dogs produce a very specific scent when they’re in heat, and intact male dogs will often wander off in order to find them.

If they aren’t getting enough <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activity</a> at home, they’ll eventually take it upon themselves to find some elsewhere. Make sure your pup’s environment is stimulating and that you are spending enough playing and <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/decoding-dog-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interacting with him</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Fear</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStorms, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/save-your-dog-from-summertime-sadness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireworks</a>, and loud noises can all trigger fear in your dog and are potential reasons why he may run off. If your dog is consistently <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">afraid of certain situations</a>, consult your vet for the best course of treatment.

It’s challenging for dogs to understand the concept of a new, permanent home and they may try to run back to their old familiar digs. If possible, unpack familiar items first and let your pup acclimate to his new environment slowly. After a bit of time, patience, and plenty of love, he will come to understand that this is his new home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Bad Habits</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe often don’t know a dog’s full history when we adopt and bring him home. If he was able to roam spontaneously before and that freedom has now been taken away, it might be hard for him to learn the new rules. It will take some training and positive reinforcement to correct this kind of behavior, so working with a trainer is recommended.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Excitement</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust like little kids running after an ice cream truck, dogs can get easily excited by new distractions and forget their training. Squirrels, other dogs, and cats can all be tempting to chase after. My Labrador, for instance, would often run to construction sites to find workers who would gladly share their lunches with him. To correct this, make sure your dog is leashed while on walks or that your yard is secured.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Opportunity</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog digs under the fence or bolts out the front door when it’s open, it may be time to invest in some new systems. Put stones under the fence and always put his leash on before anyone opens the front door.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNo matter how well you think you know your dog’s behavioral tendencies, it’s important that all dogs are microchipped and always wearing tags.

Research shows that dogs exhibit recognition for both their littermates and biological mothers. In one study, 5-week-old puppies were released into a room with wire enclosures on either side. One side housed the puppies’ mothers and littermates, while the other housed random puppies and adult female dogs. In both instances, the puppies were significantly more likely to walk over to the side of the room with their relatives than the side with strangers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nResearchers hypothesized that these results were based on scent cues, and went on to successfully test this theory by repeating the study using towels with each dog’s scent instead of the dogs themselves. The results were nearly identical. Taking it one step further, they repeated the study with 2-year-old-dogs who hadn’t seen their mothers since they were 8 weeks old to see if recognition stood the test of time. Both mothers and puppies recognized each other more than 75% of the time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese findings may seem heartwarming, but recognition doesn’t necessarily mean that dogs miss or yearn for their relatives when they’re apart. Rather, these studies prove more about the link between recognition and scent cues than an awareness of familial bonds. So yes, dogs recognize their canine relatives. But do they feel the same kind of love for their mothers that we feel for them?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do dogs relate to their human families?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere’s actually an encouraging difference between the way dogs recognize familiar dogs and  familiar humans. Scent still drives this type of recognition, but dogs don’t just see humans as another member of their pack.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn one study, a reward response was evoked in the brains of dogs who recognized the scent of a familiar human. This is a completely different response than the one triggered by recognizing another dog. (See: the way your dog acts on the sidewalk, pulling you in the direction of random dogs, while remaining disinterested in passing humans.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn other words, dogs know that humans aren’t<em> </em>like them, but they reserve a special part of their brains for the love and companionship we can provide. They’re not about to flash those <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/puppy-dog-eyes-feel-guilt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puppy eyes</a> at another dog, because they know dogs can’t provide kisses, belly rubs, or bowls of <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delicious food.</a> They love their caretakers because we help them meet fundamental needs they can’t satisfy on their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo this Thanksgiving, while you’re relishing the smell of home (aka butter) with your family, remember: your pup is also forming scent memories. They just have less to do with turkey and more to do with loving you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gralizzybear/">@gralizzybear</a></em>', 'What family really means to your dog', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'what-family-really-means-to-your-dog-4', '', '', '2018-04-09 11:50:45', '2018-04-09 11:50:45', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=74', 0, 'post', '', 0),

I majored in English.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDon’t believe me? Over the next few months we’ll be interviewing people from a variety of cities and industries about how bringing their working dogs to the office has impacted their lives, careers, and mental health. But first, a word from science.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Benefits of dogs in the workplace:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dogs make everything better. Even Excel spreadsheets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2. Happier employees = more productive employees.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3. Having a dog-friendly workplace creates a welcoming and warm energy, which can help with team building and recruiting. Allowing employees to bring their dogs to work also cuts the potential cost of dog walkers and daycare from their budgets, enabling them to save money five days a week.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n4. On a similar note, letting employees bring dogs to work removes the stress of tight time constraints — there’s less pressure to run home to feed or walk the dog at the end of the day. One 2008 survey of both small and big companies showed that dog-friendly offices had employees who were willing to work longer hours as well as lower rates of employee absenteeism. Employees working alongside their dogs are more inclined to stick around, finish work without feeling rushed, and go home when they’re ready.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n5. Like I said before, this is all backed by #science. <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/study-office-dogs-reduce-work-related-stress.html">A 2012 study</a> from Virginia Commonwealth University found that employees surrounded by dogs in the workplace were less stressed than those who left their pets at home. Randolph Barker, a leader on <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/17538351211215366">the VCU study</a> published in the International Journal of Workplace Health Management, described the outcome as a “low cost wellness benefit.” (I’m nailing economic theory right now.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n6. In the same study, researchers found that employees with in-office dogs reported higher productivity. Both of these benefits might be attributed to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone that decreases stress in the human body. Oxytocin, also known as the “cuddle hormone,” is released when bonding socially, snuggling, or petting and interacting with animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n7. Dogs foster a more collaborative work environment. Who needs a water cooler when you can gather ‘round a dog? Meet your cute new co-worker over a petting sesh. Everyone bonds over belly rubs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n8. Walking, feeding, or playing with a dog is a nice way to <a href="https://www.inc.com/jordan-smith/companies-find-stress-reducing-benefits-of-office-dogs.html">break up your work day</a>. We already know that sitting at a desk for nine hours isn’t great for your health. Taking a walk around the block (or even just to the treats jar at the front of the office) with your pup is an incentive to get moving in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHave a working dog who makes office life better?

Therapy dogs go a step even further, as they can help improve a host of mental and physical ailments. Here is a closer look at what therapy dogs do, the science behind their efficacy, and the steps you can take to get <em>your</em> pup certified.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What is a therapy dog?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor starters, a therapy dog is not the same thing as a service dog (it’s also not a dog with a prescription pad and PhD). A service dog is trained to provide assistance to someone with a specific disability such as blindness, epilepsy, or PTSD. This is essentially a full-time job for that dog, as his owner is usually the person for whom he provides this particular service.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA therapy dog needs training as well, but it tends to be more generalized and temperament-centric than, say, the very specific way a service dog is trained to protect his owner’s head during a seizure. Therapy dogs visit hospitals, assisted living facilities, college campuses, and even prisons, and provide love, comfort, and companionship.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou know when you’ve had a bad day at work so you walk by the pet store on your way home and spend 30 minutes watching puppies playing in the window? It’s a lot like that, on a more institutional level.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What is the science behind therapy dogs?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn addition to their winning combination of loyalty and fluffiness, dogs have been scientifically shown to make <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/5-ways-your-dog-is-making-you-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans healthier.</a> Therapy dogs in particular are proven to:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Reduce blood pressure\r\n</strong>High blood pressure (or hypertension) is a major risk for heart disease and stroke, so reduced blood pressure is tremendously important. Patients in assisted living facilities or hospitals may see lower blood pressure levels after spending extended periods of time petting a dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Increase both endorphins and oxytocin\r\n</strong>Endorphins are essentially a naturally occurring form of morphine, inducing a little jolt of euphoria when activated (think: the high you feel after going on a long run). Oxytocin is also a very powerful hormone – often called “the love hormone” – and gets triggered when you hug or kiss a loved one (or see a friendly tail wagging your way). It’s also believed to be the chemical backbone that underlies the feeling of trust.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lower cortisol levels\r\n</strong>Cortisol is a steroid hormone released in response to stress, and it mostly works to increase blood sugar and assist in the metabolism of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Things like massage therapy and laughter <em>lower</em> cortisol levels, while caffeine, sleep deprivation, and severe trauma <em>increase</em> them. Which category would you rather fall into?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOf course, not <em>every</em> dog has the temperament to be a therapy dog. My own dog, for example, has such an <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense fear of strangers</a> that most interactions lead to skyrocketing blood pressures for all parties involved. This, among other reasons, is why he won’t be signing up for therapy duty anytime soon. Think your dog has what it takes?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How can my pup become a therapy dog?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you’re thinking about turning your dog into a charitable super hero, he’ll need to exhibit a few prerequisites. Is your dog naturally calm and friendly around strangers? Do crowds, loud noises, and sudden movements give him anxiety? Has he received (and excelled in) at least basic obedience training?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf the answer to all of the above is yes, then congratulations! You’re on your way to becoming a dynamic therapy duo (you, as the handler, are an important part of this equation too). To become a licensed therapy dog, you and your pup will need to pass a test and get certified by an official registry. Though the specifics of the test will vary between registries, most tests gauge your dog’s ability to sit, stay, walk through a crowd, and respond to other commands.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce you’re registered and ready to go, you can ask your registry for a list or simply reach out to hospitals, nursing homes, or any other group you feel could benefit from quality time with your newly anointed therapy dog. The world is your oyster; some therapy dogs even visit children’s libraries and sit with kids who are learning to read. Your dog’s patient, nonjudgmental gaze can help a child develop the confidence he or she will need to continue improving those reading skills.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou might not be able to heal the world, but your dog’s love and companionship can help brighten it. And if nothing else, it will give him a reason to work for those treats.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gralizzybear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@gralizzybear</a> </em>', 'How your therapy dog can change someone’s life', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-your-therapy-dog-can-change-someones-life-4', '', '', '2018-04-09 11:48:14', '2018-04-09 11:48:14', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=78', 0, 'post', '', 0),

They spend the rest of their days sprawled out on our wooden floors in a way that honestly makes them look pretty dead.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut there’s a big difference between dogs who enjoy snoozing in a patch of sunlight after a long day of sprints and ones who are consistently lethargic. Not sure which camp your dog lies in? Let’s take a look.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Signs of lethargy</em> in dogs include napping way more than usual and a diminished interest in eating or drinking. Lethargic dogs can also have delayed responses to external stimuli, like someone calling their name or tossing them a tennis ball. In other words, dogs get dazed and confused, too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour dog might be lethargic after a particularly long day and can perk back up in as little as 24 hours, but if you notice signs of lethargy for days at a time, you might want to consider other causes. Like in humans, lethargy in dogs can be caused by both physical and mental issues like <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/causes-of-dog-diarrhea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diarrhea</a>, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>, and infection, as well as <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> and depression. When coupled with any of these ailments, lethargy is a sign that it’s time to see the vet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are at-home ways to improve your dog’s energy levels, too. An <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improperly balanced</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly processed</a> diet can lead to the same sluggish feelings of lethargy you experience after eating pasta for three days straight. Consider adding fresh foods like  <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vegetables </a>(or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/sardines-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sardines</a> if you’re feeling creative) to your dog’s bowl for a boost of nutrients and energy. Research shows that fresh food can help build strong immunity and increase vitality in dogs, so you can also switch your pup to a regular diet of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real, unprocessed food</a> to kick that 3pm slump for good.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA Saturday in bed is necessary every once in a while, but we all know fitness is in and the same goes for your dog. Adding extra <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercise to your dog’s routine</a> can help balance energy levels and give you both a little more pep in your step.

In addition to the emotional distress that Halloween can cause, that bowl of candy by the front door is also treacherous for any pet. Keep your dog away from these tricks in the treat bucket this Halloween.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Chocolate</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhether or not you have kids, chocolate is bound to make its way into your house this Halloween. Most dog owners are already aware of the dangers of chocolate for dogs, but here’s a quick refresher. The villain is a molecule found in chocolate known as <em>theobromine,</em> which is very difficult for dogs to digest. Not all chocolate is equally poisonous; dark chocolate contains more than six times the amount of the deadly molecule than milk chocolate, which means those Kit Kat Halloween Darkness candies are especially spooky. Smaller dogs are at a greater risk of getting sick than bigger breeds, and symptoms include vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, and increased heart rate. If ingested in large quantities, this sinister treat can lead to death, so keep that candy bowl far out of reach.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Garlic</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGarlic is a key weapon in the fight against vampires, but it can also have adverse effects on your dog’s health. Garlic contains thiosulfate which damages red blood cells and can cause anemia. This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Raisins</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Candy</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach. Instead of chocolate or candy, chop up some <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh treats</a> for your dog to enjoy, like apples or carrots. They may not be as decadent as your treats, but your dog’s health is a far better investment.

Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\r\n<h5><strong>Why do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. teeth, nails, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>Grooming by coat type</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog? Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome dogs also have an undercoat, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How does your dog’s diet affect coat health?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair. The important ones here are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (both of which you can find in superfoods like olive oil!). Omega-3s help to reduce general inflammation, which can cut down on dander and combat any bites or allergies, while omega-6s stimulate hair growth.

There are times, however, when something goes awry and your dog’s digestive system stops working as smoothly as it should.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nConstipation is a condition characterized by difficult, infrequent, or completely absent bowel movements. Dogs are normally very regular, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/decoding-your-dogs-poop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">producing stools</a> once or twice a day, but they are just as prone to digestive difficulties as humans. Here is what you need to know about constipation in your<em> </em>dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What Causes Constipation in Dogs?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nConstipation is one of the most common digestive problems seen in dogs and is typically easy to diagnose. Some of the most common symptoms of constipation include:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Forceful but ineffective attempts to defecate\r\n2. Small, hard, or dry stools Redness or swelling around the anus\r\n3. Discharge from the anus after defecating\r\n4. Loss of appetite and/or weight loss\r\n5. Lethargy or depression\r\n6. Pain when defecating\r\n7. Scooting the bottom on the floor\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog hasn’t had a bowel movement in more than a day or two, it is a sure sign of constipation. But what exactly leads to constipation?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of causes ranging from inadequate fiber content in your dog’s diet to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/save-your-dog-from-summertime-sadness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>. Constipation can also be caused by an enlarged prostate gland, excessive self-grooming, injury or trauma to the pelvis, and various neurological disorders. It can also be a side effect of certain medications or the result of an intestinal blockage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What Can You Do About It?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMild cases of constipation in dogs typically resolve themselves with time, but more severe cases may require intervention. If your dog has only been constipated for a day or two, something as simple as stirring a little canned pumpkin (the human-grade variety is perfect!) into his food can provide a boost of fiber that might get things moving again. Increasing your dog’s <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water intake </a>or switching to <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fresh food diet </a>with natural moisture can help as well.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf neither of these relieve your dog’s constipation, you may want to talk to your veterinarian about a stool softener, laxative, or other medication to help get your dog’s digestion back on track. In some cases, an enema might become necessary to evacuate the bowel, but this is definitely not something you should try at home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How Do You Prevent Constipation?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOlder dogs are more likely to develop constipation because their bowel activity naturally decreases with age. If your dog doesn’t drink a lot of water, he is also at risk for developing constipation. So, how do you prevent your dog from becoming constipated?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe best thing you can do is feed your pup a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy, high-quality diet</a> that includes fresh, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real food</a>.

You may also want to consider supplementing with <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/does-your-dog-need-probiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probiotics</a> to help ensure healthy and regular digestion.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough constipation is usually a short-lived problem that resolves itself with time, chronic or prolonged constipation is not something you should ignore.

(90, 1, '2018-03-29 07:23:17', '2018-03-29 07:23:17', 'My dogs have two moods: manic and sleepy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe live in a ranch with a long hallway that stretches from one end of the house to the other, and in their most manic moments my dogs like to sprint back and forth, breathlessly racing each other to an invisible finish line. They spend the rest of their days sprawled out on our wooden floors in a way that honestly makes them look pretty dead.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut there’s a big difference between dogs who enjoy snoozing in a patch of sunlight after a long day of sprints and ones who are consistently lethargic. Not sure which camp your dog lies in? Let’s take a look.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Signs of lethargy</em> in dogs include napping way more than usual and a diminished interest in eating or drinking. Lethargic dogs can also have delayed responses to external stimuli, like someone calling their name or tossing them a tennis ball. In other words, dogs get dazed and confused, too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour dog might be lethargic after a particularly long day and can perk back up in as little as 24 hours, but if you notice signs of lethargy for days at a time, you might want to consider other causes. Like in humans, lethargy in dogs can be caused by both physical and mental issues like <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/causes-of-dog-diarrhea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diarrhea</a>, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>, and infection, as well as <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> and depression. When coupled with any of these ailments, lethargy is a sign that it’s time to see the vet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are at-home ways to improve your dog’s energy levels, too. An <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improperly balanced</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly processed</a> diet can lead to the same sluggish feelings of lethargy you experience after eating pasta for three days straight. Consider adding fresh foods like  <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vegetables </a>(or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/sardines-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sardines</a> if you’re feeling creative) to your dog’s bowl for a boost of nutrients and energy. Research shows that fresh food can help build strong immunity and increase vitality in dogs, so you can also switch your pup to a regular diet of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real, unprocessed food</a> to kick that 3pm slump for good.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA Saturday in bed is necessary every once in a while, but we all know fitness is in and the same goes for your dog. Adding extra <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercise to your dog’s routine</a> can help balance energy levels and give you both a little more pep in your step.

Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\r\n<h5><strong>Why do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. teeth, nails, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>Grooming by coat type</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog? Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome dogs also have an undercoat, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How does your dog’s diet affect coat health?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair. The important ones here are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (both of which you can find in superfoods like olive oil!). Omega-3s help to reduce general inflammation, which can cut down on dander and combat any bites or allergies, while omega-6s stimulate hair growth. A healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids ultimately results in a strong and lustrous coat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you think your dog might have an omega-3 or omega-6 deficiency, you can supplement his diet with fish or flaxseed oil or switch to a fresh, balanced meal plan. If you’re home cooking for your dog or supplementing yourself, check in with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure that you’re feeding a balanced diet. Brushing, bathing, and feeding your dog right?

In addition to the emotional distress that Halloween can cause, that bowl of candy by the front door is also treacherous for any pet. Keep your dog away from these tricks in the treat bucket this Halloween.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Chocolate</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhether or not you have kids, chocolate is bound to make its way into your house this Halloween. Most dog owners are already aware of the dangers of chocolate for dogs, but here’s a quick refresher. The villain is a molecule found in chocolate known as <em>theobromine,</em> which is very difficult for dogs to digest. Not all chocolate is equally poisonous; dark chocolate contains more than six times the amount of the deadly molecule than milk chocolate, which means those Kit Kat Halloween Darkness candies are especially spooky. Smaller dogs are at a greater risk of getting sick than bigger breeds, and symptoms include vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, and increased heart rate. If ingested in large quantities, this sinister treat can lead to death, so keep that candy bowl far out of reach.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Garlic</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGarlic is a key weapon in the fight against vampires, but it can also have adverse effects on your dog’s health. Garlic contains thiosulfate which damages red blood cells and can cause anemia. This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Raisins</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Candy</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach. Instead of chocolate or candy, chop up some <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh treats</a> for your dog to enjoy, like apples or carrots. They may not be as decadent as your treats, but your dog’s health is a far better investment. Someone needs to be around to keep you safe during those scary movies.\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/">@butterandwilson</a></em>', 'Keep your dog safe from these tricks in halloween treats', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'keep-your-dog-safe-from-these-tricks-in-halloween-treats-4', '', '', '2018-04-09 10:23:51', '2018-04-09 10:23:51', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=94', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(145, 1, '2018-03-30 07:23:21', '2018-03-30 07:23:21', 'Health-conscious consumers are skilled at deciphering nutrition facts labels. We know to monitor our sodium intake, avoid carrageenan and high fructose corn syrup, and understand that even organic, all-natural potato chips are still chips.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPet food products, however, remain a mystery. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet food marketing</a> aims to paint a picture of health (think: images of farms and fresh vegetables on a shelf-stable bag of brown kibble), and every company promises to be the best option for your dog. It’s tempting to throw in the towel on label vigilance in the pet food aisle and blindly believe the bags, but understanding your dog’s food labels is just as important as carefully examining your own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStep one: learn to recognize the food label tricks that most pet companies are using.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>First ingredient</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust because an ingredient is listed first on a label, doesn’t mean it’s the most potent in the product. Pet food companies know that most consumers are searching for a real meat source in that prized first ingredient slot. It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Natural</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible. Stick to foods you can see and the whole feeding process becomes a lot less tricky.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenikrauze/">@jenikrauze</a></em>', 'The 11 Dog Food Label Tricks Every Owner Needs to Know', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-11-dog-food-label-tricks-every-owner-needs-to-know', '', '', '2018-04-09 12:31:13', '2018-04-09 12:31:13', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=145', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Packed with dietary fiber and potassium, pumpkins are a superfood that can benefit your dog’s health (and waistline) all year.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA cup of plain pumpkin contains about 80 calories with a whopping 10 grams of dietary fiber – that’s about 1.25 grams of fiber per ounce. A serving this size also contains 1 gram of fat, 2 grams of protein, and just 5 mg of sodium.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dietary fiber and high moisture content can aid with digestion, relieve diarrhea, and prevent constipation\r\n2. Fiber acts as a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/does-your-dog-need-probiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probiotic</a>, supporting the growth and activity of helpful bacteria in your dog’s digestive tract\r\n3. Natural oils in both pumpkin and pumpkin seeds are rich in phytoestrogens, which can lower blood pressure and support heart health\r\n4. Pumpkin (like other <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">orange veggies</a>) is rich in beta-carotene and other antioxidants which may reduce your dog’s risk for cancer and can promote healthy vision\r\n5.

If your dog is suffering from diarrhea or constipation, try stirring a tablespoon or two of canned pumpkin into his normal food once a day to relieve symptoms. Feeling a little more culinary? Toast <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/superfoods-kitchen-pumpkin-seeds-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raw pumpkin seeds</a> at home with a drizzle of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/superfoods-kitchen-coconut-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coconut</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/olive-oil-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">olive</a> oil and serve them as a tasty treat, or grind them up and stir them into your dog’s food. You can also combine canned pumpkin with a cup of plain yogurt and freeze the mixture in ice cube trays for a refreshing, DIY treat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What to Watch For:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlways be sure to buy plain canned pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling.

Used both as garnish and an ingredient, parsley comes in several different varieties. Flat-leaf parsley, also known as Italian parsley, has large, flat leaves and adds robust flavors in cooking (think soups, stews, and sauces) while curly parsley is primarily used for decoration. But it’s more than just a pretty face.\r\nThe Stats:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPer tablespoon of chopped herb, parsley contains just 1 calorie and no fat or cholesterol. It contains less than 1 gram of carbohydrates, fiber, and protein but it is fairly rich in Vitamins A, C, and K as well as trace minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Parsley also boasts several volatile oils which have natural anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their antimicrobial and carminative benefits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to parsley for dogs, you should only feed the curly variety. Watch those serving sizes, as parsley does contain a toxic compound called furanocoumarin which can be dangerous in excessive amounts. In smaller servings, however, parsley does your dog more good than harm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Benefits:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Freshens bad breath thanks to microbial properties\r\n2. Rich in antioxidants that protect against free-radical damage\r\n3. Relieves swelling and pain from arthritis and other inflammatory conditions\r\n4. Vitamin K content improves blood clotting and boosts liver health\r\n5. Helps soothe upset stomach and digestive problems\r\n6. Diuretic properties help prevent urinary tract infections\r\n7. Immune system support via Vitamin C\r\n8. Helps flush toxins from the body, supporting kidney health\r\n9. Vitamin A content supports vision and eye health\r\n10. Can slow the rate of growth for tumors and certain cancers\r\nHow to Feed It:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWondering how to incorporate parsley into your dog’s diet? He may not chomp down on a fresh bunch right off the bat, but adding a little to his regular food a few times a week should do the trick. If you’re concerned about accidentally giving your dog too much parsley, play it safe by blending with water (1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight) and creating a juice you can pour right into your his water bowl. You can also brew parsley root into a tea (1 teaspoon per 10 pounds of bodyweight), or bake some into homemade dog treats.

Probiotics are good microbes (either bacteria or yeasts) that live in the digestive tract and help fight off the growth and activity of bad bacteria like E. coli and salmonella. In humans, they can boost our immune systems and improve gastrointestinal issues like diarrhea, IBS, and intestinal inflammations. While there are fewer studies on the effects of probiotics on dogs, there are a few known strains that can help your pup with digestion and upset stomach.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog is experiencing stomach troubles, your vet might suggest one of two alternatives: prebiotics work with the good bacteria already living in your dog’s colon to nourish it and promote growth, while probiotics nourish and combat any bad bacteria that might have infected your dog. Consult with your vet on the best option for your pup.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMany pet owners supplement their dogs’ diets with probiotics when they are experiencing gastrointestinal issues, many of which are caused by a highly processed diet of dry kibble. <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fresh, lightly cooked food</a>, on the other hand, is notoriously easier to digest than <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commercial pet foods</a>, and most dogs on a fresh diet do not require any additional probiotic supplements.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStill, adding probiotics to your dog’s diet isn’t any more harmful than your midday kombucha habit. Probiotics for dogs come in various forms, from powders to chews and capsules. Mixing yogurt or kefir with live cultures into your dog’s food is also an easy option, assuming you don’t mind sharing your breakfast.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHave probiotics helped your pup?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/milletandlara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@milletandlara</a></em>', 'Does Your Dog Need Probiotics, Too?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'does-your-dog-need-probiotics-too', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:49:54', '2018-04-09 09:49:54', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=161', 0, 'post', '', 0),

It’s full of trace minerals like calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, folate, potassium, and zinc which all play a key role in balanced nutrition\r\n3.

It’s had supporting roles in Thanksgiving stuffings and frequently stars alongside rosemary and thyme in various poultry recipes. But how much do you know about the benefits of sage for dogs?\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\nSage comes in different forms that have both medicinal and culinary applications. Garden sage (<i>Salvia officinalis</i>) is the most common variety, known for its soft, silvery green leaves. Pineapple sage (<i>Salvia elegans</i>) is highly attractive to hummingbirds and is used more for its medicinal benefits than for its flavor. Both golden sage and purple sage are grown ornamentally and for culinary application, while Berggarten sage produces particularly large, aromatic leaves. In addition to having a wonderful flavor and aroma, sage offers natural antiseptic, antibacterial, antimicrobial, and astringent properties.\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n1.  Contains Vitamins A, E, and K which support bone, skin, and eye health in addition to promoting healthy immunity\r\n2. Loaded with trace minerals like calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and zinc to support balanced nutrition\r\n3. The astringent properties of sage reduce redness and inflammation to heal skin infections\r\n4. Sage leaves can be used to ease gas or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/every-pet-owner-needs-know-bloat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bloating</a> and to treat gastrointestinal tract infections\r\n5. The leaves of the sage plant contain <em>rosmarinic acid</em> which may reduce the symptoms of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/remedies-for-your-dogs-allergies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seasonal allergies</a>\r\n6. Antioxidant properties which may help to protect against oxidation in the cells and reduce free-radical damage\r\n7. Antimicrobial properties naturally kill harmful pathogens that could cause infection\r\n8. Oils in the plant contain <em>ketones, </em>which can improve mental clarity and protect against cognitive decline\r\n9. Contains dietary fiber which may support healthy digestion and relieve constipation or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/causes-of-dog-diarrhea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diarrhea</a>\r\n10. Natural anti-inflammatory benefits may help relieve arthritis <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-signs-dog-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain</a> and other inflammatory conditions\r\n<h4>How to Feed It:</h4>\r\nThe easiest way to include sage in your dog’s diet is to mix fresh or dried leaves into his food. You can also boil dried sage leaves and Epsom salts in water to create a topical application to heal skin infections. As with many other superfood herbs, you can also bake sage into homemade dog treats.\r\n<h4>What to Watch For:</h4>\r\nUnlike some herbs which can cause digestive upset in large doses, sage is recognized by the ASPCA as being non-toxic for dogs. You should still limit your dog’s intake to a few leaves a day, but there’s no <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">danger of poisoning</a>.\r\n\r\nDo you have any helpful tips for growing sage?

Health conscious humans are well-versed in the benefits of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/beauty-and-brains-the-benefits-of-coconut-oil-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy fats</a>, but don’t hog the bottle; your dog is far from immune to the perks.\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\nAs you might have guessed, olive oil is extracted from… olives! It’s been used in cooking for thousands of years and is primarily comprised of monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, and antioxidants. It contains about 120 calories per tablespoon and 14 grams of fat (the good kind!).\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n1. Monounsaturated fatty acids support fat breakdown in the cells, helping to shed stored fat\r\n2. Antioxidant content protects against free-radical damage and oxidation to increase lifespan\r\n3. Natural anti-inflammatory properties help reduce the risk for serious diseases like cancer, heart\r\ndisease, and diabetes\r\n4. Supports healthy brain function and helps to prevent cognitive decline, especially in older dogs\r\n5. Oleic acid content works with other beneficial compounds to protect against cancer\r\n6. Healthy monounsaturated fatty acids support heart health by reducing cholesterol\r\n7. Helps to increase blood flow for improved heart health and general health\r\n8. Reduces effects of asthma and supports respiratory health (particularly for brachycephalic breeds)\r\n9. Improves coat condition and moisturizes dry and flaky skin\r\n10. Makes food more palatable and attractive to dogs, especially for picky eaters\r\n<h4>How to Feed It:</h4>\r\nThe simplest way to incorporate olive oil into your dog’s diet is to drizzle it over his food or use it as an ingredient in homemade dog treats. Just don’t serve your dog salad that’s been slathered in dressing.

Loaded with fiber and a healthy dose of protein, pumpkin seeds pack a powerful nutritional punch and are delicious to boot.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPumpkin seeds contain about 125 calories per ounce. A serving this size contains 5 grams of fat, 5 grams of protein, and 15 grams of carbohydrates. It also contains a whopping 5 grams of dietary fiber! Pumpkin seeds are incredibly rich in phosphorus and magnesium and contain a significant amount of copper, zinc, calcium, iron, and antioxidants as well.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Act as a natural de-wormer to get rid of tapeworms and other intestinal parasites\r\n2. May help dislodge kidney stones and prevent them from reforming\r\n3.

Use no more than one tablespoon per 50 pounds of bodyweight and limit your use to twice a week. If your dog doesn’t like the strong flavor, try reducing the amount to 1 teaspoon per 50 pounds of bodyweight, cooking it into a homemade dog treat, or stirring some into your dog’s <a href="http://www.thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh meals</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Other Uses:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog won’t ingest apple cider vinegar because of the taste, you can still use it as a natural ear cleaner or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/diy-guide-grooming-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIY</a> flea repellant rinse. To make an ear cleaning solution, mix equal parts water and apple cider vinegar, then dip a cotton ball in the solution and gently use it to clean your dog’s ears. For a DIY flea rinse, mix 1 cup distilled water with ½ cup each of apple cider vinegar and brewed green tea (cooled) and then apply it to your dog’s coat after bathing.

It’s a good time to review the most <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/">dangerous foods for your dog</a> (toxic ingredients like onion and garlic are often hidden in dishes like soups and stews), but contrary to popular belief, not all table food is bad for our dogs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo where does this myth come from?<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/"> Marketing, for starters</a>. After the invention of processed dog food, manufacturers were still struggling to successfully convince pet owners to replace real food with new, commercial varieties. So in the mid 1960s, the pet food industry launched a marketing campaign imploring consumers to “Ban All Table Scraps” from their pets’ bowls and switch to dry kibble. It worked, and we’ve been scared to give our dogs human food ever since. While the kibble guys were right in that you don’t want to train your dog to beg at the table or feed those garlic potatoes you just fried up, most people are starting to understand that a fresh food diet is a much healthier option for dogs. What some pet owners may not know is that even feeding the right table scraps can also be healthful and beneficial.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><b>How</b><b> do I know what “real” foods I can feed my dog?</b></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAvoid anything fried or cooked with additives and stick with <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/">whole, fresh foods</a> like meat, vegetables, and fruit. These are best in their natural states or lightly cooked, and are not only safe for your dogs, but also beneficial for their health. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/">Fresh food is also easier for your pup to digest</a> than processed dog food and can lead to better breath, a shinier coat, and a trimmer waistline. How many brown balls of kibble can promise that?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRemember, a few pieces of fresh turkey or broccoli in your dog’s bowl can be an amazing snack, but doesn’t count as a regular, balanced meal. If you want to experience the benefits of switching your dog over to an all-fresh diet, make sure you’re feeding<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/"> nutritionally balanced recipes</a> that have been formulated by a veterinary nutritionist.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><b>Any specific table scraps I should avoid?</b></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhile certain table foods are safe to share with your dog, you should keep the pizza and French Fries for your own cheat days. Everyone knows about chocolate, but here’s a quick recap of the table scraps that still deserve their bad rep.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Fried foods or dishes with added salt and spices\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Most Americans cook with copious amounts of butter and oil, making many holiday dishes a potential nutritional land mine for dogs (and humans)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Garlic and onion (they contain <i>allium</i>, which can damage your dog’s red blood cells and even cause them to burst)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Grapes and raisins (the exact toxin in this fruit family hasn’t been pinpointed, but grapes are high on the No Fly List for your dog’s bowl)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Packaged foods (artificial sweeteners like <em>x</em><em>ylitol</em> can sneak into packaged desserts, candies, and condiments and are some of the most dangerous ingredients for dogs)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Peaches and avocados (peach pits are poisonous, to say nothing of their danger as a choking hazard, while avocados contain a toxin called <i>persin</i>)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Tomato plants (a ripe tomato is fine, but a green tomato or any part of the plant itself can be toxic)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Cooked bones (chicken bones, we’re looking at you)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Raw potatoes (cooked is safe, but skip the buttery mashed variety)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhile your pup would no doubt love a plate of macaroni and cheese this holiday, rich foods can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and even pancreatitis if consumed in high quantities. The good news is that your dog will be just as happy enjoying a plate of steamed Brussels sprouts dressed in Turkey broth. So go ahead, put some leftover superfoods in that bowl and let the dogs join in on the holiday fun this year.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ps.ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ps.ny</a></em>', 'The Truth About Table Scraps for Dogs', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-truth-about-table-scraps-for-dogs', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:48:22', '2018-04-09 09:48:22', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=174', 0, 'post', '', 0),

We know to monitor our sodium intake, avoid carrageenan and high fructose corn syrup, and understand that even organic, all-natural potato chips are still chips.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPet food products, however, remain a mystery. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet food marketing</a> aims to paint a picture of health (think: images of farms and fresh vegetables on a shelf-stable bag of brown kibble), and every company promises to be the best option for your dog. It’s tempting to throw in the towel on label vigilance in the pet food aisle and blindly believe the bags, but understanding your dog’s food labels is just as important as carefully examining your own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStep one: learn to recognize the food label tricks that most pet companies are using.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>First ingredient</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust because an ingredient is listed first on a label, doesn’t mean it’s the most potent in the product. Pet food companies know that most consumers are searching for a real meat source in that prized first ingredient slot. It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Natural</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible. Stick to foods you can see and the whole feeding process becomes a lot less tricky.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenikrauze/">@jenikrauze</a></em>', 'The 11 Dog Food Label Tricks Every Owner Needs to Know', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-11-dog-food-label-tricks-every-owner-needs-to-know-2__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:28:10', '2018-04-10 14:28:10', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=176', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Toast <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/superfoods-kitchen-pumpkin-seeds-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raw pumpkin seeds</a> at home with a drizzle of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/superfoods-kitchen-coconut-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coconut</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/olive-oil-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">olive</a> oil and serve them as a tasty treat, or grind them up and stir them into your dog’s food. You can also combine canned pumpkin with a cup of plain yogurt and freeze the mixture in ice cube trays for a refreshing, DIY treat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What to Watch For:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlways be sure to buy plain canned pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling. When it comes to your dog’s digestive system, added sugar and spice are anything but nice.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="http://www.food52.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Food52</a></em>', 'Superfoods in Your Kitchen: Pumpkins for Dogs', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'superfoods-in-your-kitchen-pumpkins-for-dogs-2', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:47:54', '2018-04-09 09:47:54', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=178', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Used both as garnish and an ingredient, parsley comes in several different varieties. Flat-leaf parsley, also known as Italian parsley, has large, flat leaves and adds robust flavors in cooking (think soups, stews, and sauces) while curly parsley is primarily used for decoration. But it’s more than just a pretty face.\r\nThe Stats:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPer tablespoon of chopped herb, parsley contains just 1 calorie and no fat or cholesterol. It contains less than 1 gram of carbohydrates, fiber, and protein but it is fairly rich in Vitamins A, C, and K as well as trace minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Parsley also boasts several volatile oils which have natural anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their antimicrobial and carminative benefits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to parsley for dogs, you should only feed the curly variety. Watch those serving sizes, as parsley does contain a toxic compound called furanocoumarin which can be dangerous in excessive amounts. In smaller servings, however, parsley does your dog more good than harm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Benefits:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Freshens bad breath thanks to microbial properties\r\n2. Rich in antioxidants that protect against free-radical damage\r\n3. Relieves swelling and pain from arthritis and other inflammatory conditions\r\n4. Vitamin K content improves blood clotting and boosts liver health\r\n5. Helps soothe upset stomach and digestive problems\r\n6. Diuretic properties help prevent urinary tract infections\r\n7. Immune system support via Vitamin C\r\n8. Helps flush toxins from the body, supporting kidney health\r\n9. Vitamin A content supports vision and eye health\r\n10. Can slow the rate of growth for tumors and certain cancers\r\nHow to Feed It:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWondering how to incorporate parsley into your dog’s diet? He may not chomp down on a fresh bunch right off the bat, but adding a little to his regular food a few times a week should do the trick. If you’re concerned about accidentally giving your dog too much parsley, play it safe by blending with water (1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight) and creating a juice you can pour right into your his water bowl. You can also brew parsley root into a tea (1 teaspoon per 10 pounds of bodyweight), or bake some into homemade dog treats. A new twist on tea and cookies for the whole gang.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nImage: Food52', 'Superfoods in Your Kitchen: Parsley for Dogs', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'superfoods-in-your-kitchen-parsley-for-dogs-2', '', '', '2018-04-09 12:29:37', '2018-04-09 12:29:37', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=180', 0, 'post', '', 0),

When she isn’t collaborating with athleisure brands like Bandier or developing her own fashion line, Arielle soaks up quality time with her 1-year-old daughter, Ruby Lou. Instagram followers can’t get enough of the mother-daughter duo, and Arielle’s feed is full of candid videos of the pair sharing dance parties, watching their favorite movies, and eating home cooked meals together. We caught up with the powerhouse NYC mom about her dog, Dylan, and her favorite morning rituals with her family.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>When did you first become a dog mom? Tell us a little bit about Dylan and what makes your relationship special.</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI got Dylan 5 years ago with my boyfriend (now husband) as our first dog together. We had met another dog that we thought we wanted, but once we met Dylan we knew he was meant to be part of our family. Dylan is so special to us because he was my first “born.” He started our family, which has now grown into four along with his baby sister, Ruby.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How do you prioritize Dylan’s health in your daily routine? </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan’s health has always been very important to us and we always thought we were giving him the best. He wound up developing HGE and was in hospitals on and off, and we tried so many different brands of food. We thankfully found <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Farmer’s Dog</a> and that has been a game changer!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’re also mom to a beautiful baby girl named Ruby! How did you prepare Dylan for the transition of having a new baby in the house?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen we first had Ruby, we took her blanket from the hospital and put it in Dylan’s bed so he could get familiar with her scent. At first we were very cautious because we didn’t know how he would adjust to a new family member. Now Ruby can’t get enough of him and they are best friends! They love watching <em>The Secret Life of Pets</em> together. They do everything together.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your favorite part of being a mom?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s ALL amazing. I couldn’t be happier. But the best part is waking her up every morning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How has your view of health changed since having Ruby?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSince having Ruby, we are constantly cooking at home. We’re always trying new things to find out what Ruby likes, which has made us <em>all</em> more health conscious!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What does a typical healthy day look like for you, Dylan, and Ruby? Are there special activities that the three of you share?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan, Ruby, and I have a morning ritual! The three of us take a walk to get coffee, and if the weather is really nice we’ll walk into SoHo for breakfast.

Kai, my 95-pound Dogo Argentino “lap dog” who thinks she’s the size of a chihuahua, has just about every allergy under the sun. No wheat or grains. Absolutely no chicken. Heck, it cost me $1,000 at the dog <em>dermatologist</em> to determine she’s also allergic to the sun. So, yeah, I’m a bit crazy, especially when we’re out and a well-intentioned, dog-loving person offers Kai a treat, which is bound to make her have diarrhea for a week — and/or give her a gnarly rash.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo, you can see why I jumped at the chance to try <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, a food delivery service for our four-legged friends that features <em>real</em> food (tested on humans!), created with board-certified veterinary nutritionists, and is customized to fit individual dog’s needs. It’s great for all dogs, but especially the ones with those special dietary needs like Kai. And after I’ve switched her food countless times, I was so excited to try something new that didn’t involve randomly picking a new “hypo-allergenic” dog food off a shelf at the pet store.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInstead, here’s how The Farmer’s Dog works: You fill out an <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/#signup-box">online questionnaire</a> about your dog’s size, weight, activity level, protein preference (turkey, beef, or pork) etc., then you’ll get back a customized food plan that’s delivered to you every two weeks in pre-portioned packets. You keep 5 at a time in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer (you might have to clear out some of your frozen pizza stash to make room, but you’ll survive). Then you simply feed your pup one of the packets from the fridge at breakfast and one at dinner and you’re done! There’s no measuring or hassle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKai could hardly contain herself when I received the first shipment of food and now that we’re 2 weeks into her new food regimen, there’s no way she’ll settle for kibble again.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are three awesome things that happened in the first two weeks of using The Farmer’s Dog:\r\n<h4><strong>1. My Dog’s Allergies Got SO Much Better</strong></h4>\r\nHow do I know when Kai’s allergies are bad? The easiest sign is that the hair on her head gets splotchy (see photos below). Within a week of eating The Farmer’s Dog food, the area looked significantly better. She wasn’t itchy at all and the sensitive skin on her belly returned to the normal pink color, instead of reddish and irritated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd TMI alert — her poop looked better than ever. Believe me, it’s easy to tell when you have a 95-pound dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Farmer’s Dog food is shipped to you within days of being made in human-grade kitchens in New York and you won’t believe the difference in how it looks and smells compared to the stuff you’ve been feeding your dog. At this point, Kai is probably eating better than I am…\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>2. She LOVES Eating</strong></h4>\r\nKai already loved to eat, but she was next-level excited for mealtime these last few weeks. Even if she was sound asleep on the couch before dinner, all I had to do was walk to the fridge, take out a packet, and start to pour it in her bowl and she would spring into action — with a giant string of drool hanging out of her mouth as she waited. She never reacted like that to her previous kibble dinner. No way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome nights she’d even eat all of her food then return a few minutes later to her bowl and lick it again — just to make sure she hadn’t missed a piece.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>3. I Felt Good About Feeding Her</strong></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter trying out The Farmer’s Dog, I realized I was a crazy and also <strong>lazy</strong> dog mom. After so many failed attempts at finding the right food for her allergy needs, I stuck with a kibble that was fine but not great. I didn’t really think there was anything better out there. She wasn’t itchy or in pain with her old food (I’m not <em>that</em> bad), but after seeing the improvement with The Farmer’s Dog, it was very apparent that there was something soo much better for her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, let’s be honest: her new food plan is more expensive than her kibble (cost per week varies according to the size and needs of your dog, but plans start at about $29 a week), but my dog and her health are 100% worth it. I’ll eat out one fewer time a month or ditch that afternoon Starbucks and quickly find the extra money to keep my furry BFF happy and, most importantly, healthy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images:  </em><a href="http://www.livingly.com/team/Deena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deena Bustillo </a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'My Dog Has Terrible Allergies and This Meal Service Changed All That', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'my-dog-has-terrible-allergies-and-this-meal-service-changed-all-that', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:46:25', '2018-04-09 09:46:25', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=194', 0, 'post', '', 0),

An associate veterinarian at the Belle Haven Animal Medical Centre in Virginia and expert in animal health and nutrition, she is also the host and executive producer of <a href="http://www.thepetshow.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Pet Show with Dr. Katy</em></a>. Dr. Katy has been featured on the TODAY Show, Fox &amp; Friends, NPR, CNBC, The Meredith Vieira Show, and HuffPost Live, among others.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe sat down with Dr. Katy to talk about the importance of choosing the right diet for your dog, the advice she would give every aspiring vet, and why she’s dedicated her life to animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Tell us a little bit about your career path. When did you first know you wanted to be a veterinarian?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI grew up in South Louisiana and animals were always a huge part of my life. You name it, we had it — chickens, cows, even the occasional rabbit.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy dad’s best friend was a veterinarian when I was growing up, and one summer in college he told me about a job opening at a small local zoo. I was pre-med at the time, but I went and worked and a six week position turned into 13 weeks. I absolutely loved it and thought, “This is it. This is what I want to do.” I went back to school that fall and changed my major to a pre-vet track. Two years after that, I went to Louisiana State University’s School of Veterinary Medicine.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s one piece of advice you would give to someone who wants to become a vet?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think the biggest mistake people make when they go into veterinary medicine is thinking, “I don’t want to work with people; I just want to work with animals!” One of the biggest parts of our job is actually people relations. Like pediatricians, we have patients who can’t talk and can’t tell us where it hurts, and we have very concerned parents advocating for them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy biggest piece of advice for someone who wants to be a veterinarian is to take psychology, economics, and business classes. Having interpersonal communication skills and being business savvy is a big part of being a really good vet. Vets are highly intelligent people with big hearts, but most of them are also small business owners and there actually isn’t any business training in veterinary school.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce you make the decision that being a vet is what you want, dive in and study hard. It ain’t easy!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’re very vocal about the importance of nutrition for dogs. How big of an impact do you think food has on our dogs’ health and well-being?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs a mom, I’ve really delved hard into thinking about what I’m putting in my kids’ bodies. We all put so much time and interest into what we’re eating because we know it has an impact. We are what we eat, and the same thing goes for our pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf we’re feeding our pets protein that is so highly processed it’s lost all of its nutritional integrity, we’re not doing them any favors. It’s certainly cheaper in the moment, but it’s actually not cheaper in the long run when you consider that poor diet can cause diseases and health issues like diabetes down the line. If we start with good nutrition from day one, we have a heck of a better chance of our pets living long and healthy lives.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What advice do you give pet owners who are trying to choose the best food for their dog?</strong><b>\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA lot of pet health really has to do with choosing the right food for your dog. People think they’re feeding their dog really wonderful food because they’ve read a review online, or the 19-year-old restocking the shelves at the local pet store told them it was a great brand. What you really need to do is have a conversation with your vet. Your vet is going to be able to better assess your pet’s lifestyle and caloric needs and help you figure it all out.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat really impresses me so much about <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a> is that you guys are doing what I’ve been telling people to do for years. You’ve got the algorithms in place to account for lifestyle, disease, body condition, etc. and feed dogs accordingly. Pet owners need to figure out the right daily calorie count for their dogs and stick to it, remembering that treats are extra on top of that. I think one of the hardest things is for people to be honest about that. Sometimes it’s just easier not to think about it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What are some of the biggest health issues our pets are facing today? How can pet owners protect their dogs?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think the biggest epidemic we’re seeing in pets is definitely obesity. Almost 60% of American dogs are overweight or obese. That’s shocking!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe obesity issue stems from a lack of nutritional education and a lack of being able to recognize pet obesity by owners. In a study conducted by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention (APOP), pet owners were surveyed about their dogs’ weights. 100% of the dogs included in the study were considered obese, yet <em>90% of the owners</em> <em>polled</em> said their dogs were a normal weight!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPeople are completely in denial about what is and isn’t a healthy weight for their pets, but we have to start being realistic and treating pet obesity as seriously as we treat other health issues like thyroid conditions, heart disease and even cancer. We have the science to prove that pets who weigh less live longer, and we all want to give our dogs the longest, happiest lives possible. A massive part of that is nutrition. When we’re feeding our dogs good things, it translates to good health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy biggest piece of advice would be to talk with your vet and not take it personally if they tell you that your dog is overweight. Obesity is a diagnosis of a disease, not something to get offended over. They’re not saying <i>you’re</i> a bad pet owner, they’re saying your pet has a disease and it’s one you can treat and work on together as a team. If you look at it that way, you’ll have a lot more results than if you get defensive about what you’re feeding or how much exercise your dog is getting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Such important advice. Lastly, from one crazy dog lover to another, what do you think it is about dogs that makes them so special?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat I think is really cool is that in the last couple of years, even the Pope has spoken out about animals having souls. I think that’s something that we have known for years as dog owners. I know that when I look into my dog’s eyes there is a soul in there and a sentient being who loves me unconditionally, the way that I love him. It’s been validating that there have been so many books published over the last few years about how dogs touch our souls and communicate with us.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to connect with a dog, soul to soul. There are no pretenses and you don’t need makeup or your best clothes. Dogs aren’t going to judge you; they just love you. I think everyone’s goal is to find that unconditional love in life, and whether or not we find it in another human, we know our dogs love us unconditionally. Dogs give us the comfort and connection that everyone is seeking.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images: <a href="http://www.thepetshow.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katy Nelson</a></em>', 'Vets We Love: Meet Dr. Katy', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'vets-we-love-meet-dr-katy', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:45:54', '2018-04-09 09:45:54', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=196', 0, 'post', '', 0),

A former Wilhelmina model and artist, Lauren was a founding team member at <a href="https://ritual.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ritual</a>, a health tech company that’s reinventing the vitamin through simplicity and traceability. Their first product, a multivitamin for women, contains just nine vitamins and minerals, compared with more than 20 typically found in other supplements.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLauren leads Marketing and Growth at Ritual and is based out of Los Angeles with her husband and two dogs, Rocky and Apollo. We chatted with Lauren about her favorite rituals, how she thinks about nutrition for her pups, and why New Year’s Eve holds a special significance in her house.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Tell us a little bit about your dogs, Rocky and Apollo.</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOur former dog was a 14 year old lab, Rocco, and when he passed away it just felt like there was a void in our house. We had seen this litter of English Retriever puppies and fell in love with two of them. Every day for three months I kept asking my fiancé (now husband) if we could get them. We were really debating it, though, because it’s such a huge responsibility. I’m pregnant, we were planning our wedding, we both work at startups…there’s always a lot going on!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFinally, I talked to my dad about it and he told me to follow my heart and get them. I was inspired by him, so on New Year’s Eve, instead of going to this party we had tickets to, we drove to Long Beach and picked up Rocky and Apollo. We’ve never been happier! Obviously, it was the right decision and we adore them. They’re really good puppies; they understand “no,” they haven’t torn a lot up in our house, and they’re housebroken. We’ve been really lucky in that regard.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How did you choose a pet food when you first got your pups? What was your main criteria in selecting a food? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy husband and I eat healthy and are conscious of the food we put in our bodies, and we try to do the same for our dogs. I had initially thought that certain dry food brands might be a good option compared to the more mainstream ones, because it seemed like they didn’t have a lot of gross stuff in there. After doing a little bit more research, though, I learned that it was mostly marketing and that a lot of dry food is pretty much the same.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen we discovered <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, and the dogs go so crazy for it. I’ve been uploading photos and videos to my Instagram of them eating the food because it’s the funniest thing. We have these slow feeder maze bowls for them they’re ravenous all the time, and they literally go in circles in the mazes trying to eat their Farmer’s Dog food super fast. There’s always one or two chickpeas that get caught in the maze and they end up flipping over their bowls to get to them! They just love the food.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Did you notice any changes in Rocky and Apollo when you switched them to a fresh food diet?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat people notice on our dogs is that their fur is super silky. It’s gorgeous and so thick and soft! I would say an improvement in fur is one big thing. They’re very happy and super healthy all around, and I’m sure the food has a lot to do with that.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How has switching to fresh food changed the way you think about their nutrition?</b><b> </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think people should just think about it the same way they think about feeding themselves. Would you eat Lucky Charms for every meal, every day? Probably not. Our dogs are living, breathing creatures and require real nutrients. The quality of the nutrients we get from fresh foods like vegetables and meat is so much higher than it would be in processed food. I really try to apply the same principles of what I feed myself to what I feed my dogs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>In honor of your company, Ritual, tell us about your favorite rituals with Rocky and Apollo.</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThey’re always so excited to see me when I get home from work! Since I’m pregnant I’m usually really tired at the end of the day and get right in bed. They’re not supposed to come in the bed, but they’re irresistibly cute and I usually let them. My favorite daily ritual is just spending quality time with them and giving them lots of love.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/laurenahayes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Hayes </a></em>', 'This Dog Mom is Reinventing the Vitamin for Women', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'this-dog-mom-is-reinventing-the-vitamin-for-women__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:23:14', '2018-04-10 14:23:14', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=198', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Unfortunately, my stint as a pre-vet student didn’t last very long after I fainted in my dissection class, so I’ve had to find other ways to help animals.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Chicago-based animal lover spent years volunteering at shelters, and found a new way to make her mark when she created <a href="https://www.therescuerunway.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rescue Runway</a> in February 2017. The popular blog marries her love of animals and fashion by chronicling trips to local shelters and including information on both her outfits and the pictured pups in need of homes. Whenever possible, she tries to wear clothing brands that support and donate proceeds to animal organizations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHer idea has resonated with dog lovers and fashion enthusiasts alike. Within months of its launch, The Rescue Runway was featured in <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/pets/ct-chicago-fashion-blog-shelter-dogs-20170616-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Chicago Tribune</a> and received praise from fashion designer and blogger <a href="https://laurenconrad.com/blog/2017/07/lc-com-edit-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Conrad.</a> “I will never charge shelters for my “services,” so I am constantly looking for ways to partner with like-minded brands who are interested in making a fashionable social statement,” Christine shared with <em>the Digest. </em>“The goal is to make The Rescue Runway my full-time job within the next two years.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe caught up with Christine to talk dogs, blogs, and the biggest lesson animals have taught her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How was the idea for The Rescue Runway born? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI’ve always been an active volunteer at animal shelters in and around Chicago and wanted to find a way to promote adoption to a new audience. I follow many fashion bloggers and love when they share pictures of their pups, and one day I had a light bulb moment. I realized my passion for clothes could be combined with my love of equally adorable dogs (and cats!) in a new kind of fashion blog. A blog that not only shows off fun outfits, but also has a purpose behind it that people can connect with.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>You do a lot of work to raise awareness about homeless pets in Chicago. What has the response from your community been like? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo say it’s been amazing would be an understatement. Since day one, people have reached out from across the city and country telling me how wonderful of a platform this is for the rescue world. I’ve been lucky to meet some pretty incredible people in Chicago who are just as passionate about adoption as I am, and everyone has been so supportive and offered advice along the way. One of my new blogger friends just adopted her first pup and let me know that my blog helped her make the decision!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’ve written about your exploration of the </strong><a href="https://www.therescuerunway.com/single-post/kibbles-and-bits-of-everything" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.therescuerunway.com/single-post/kibbles-and-bits-of-everything&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1501617677812000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIECAyAK7qnfpy4E6X-AZHVlQYIQ"><strong>pet food industry</strong></a><strong> and your experience trying a fresh diet for your dogs Hattrick and Stanley. What’s your approach to feeding them these days? </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWriting that post was quite the eye-opener and it’s completely changed my approach to feeding my pets. Hattrick and Stanley are both working on their summer bodies and were in need of a leaner diet. Luckily, <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a> provided well-balanced meals to kick-start their weight loss goals. I’m happy to report that Stanley has lost five pounds and Hattrick is down three! I’m hoping to switch them to a total human-grade diet by the end of the year, and for now they’re eating a combination of The Farmer’s Dog and a zero-grain dog food to shave off a few more pounds!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is it about animals that makes them so special to you? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI will always be in awe of the unconditional and innocent love that animals possess. Some of my favorite dogs have been the ones who were treated so badly before being saved and are still the sweetest pups and have so much love to give. We can all learn a lesson from them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you hope people learn from visiting The Rescue Runway? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy blog is full of educational posts about things that are all important to me, but I hope the number one takeaway is just how amazing adopting a pet can be. People don’t often realize that you can rescue almost any kind of dog. Big, little, purebred or mutt, the perfect pup is out there waiting for you. It may take a little research, but I promise it’s worth it. I hear from followers all the time that in the end, it’s really the dog that rescues the person.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/therescuerunway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rescue Runway</a>', 'How One Fashion Blogger is Giving Shelter Dogs a Voice', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-one-fashion-blogger-is-giving-shelter-dogs-a-voice', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:45:08', '2018-04-09 09:45:08', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=200', 0, 'post', '', 0),

This summer, <a href="http://www.dogumenta.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dOGUMENTA (I) NYC</a> is offering pet owners (and lovers) a new opportunity to connect and experience visual art with their dogs. We sat down with founding curator Jessica Dawson to talk about the inspiration behind the exhibit and the biggest lesson dogs can teach us about art.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What inspired the launch of dOGUMENTA?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe project was inspired by my gallery visits with my rescue dog Rocky, whose insights inspired the Dogumenta manifesto “<a href="http://www.dogumenta.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 Things My Dog Taught Me About Art</a>.” I delivered the manifesto at a gallery in Brooklyn last year and felt that it was time for canines to have an art show all their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How did you begin curating the exhibit? What kind of visual artists did you want to include?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce we found our venue partner (Brookfield Place in New York), we started hounding artists whose work we found interesting. All of the artists we’re featuring in the show responded immediately to the concept and understood how it operated on multiple levels at once. Mica Scalin (my creative development consultant and partner) and I vetted their capabilities, and then we brought Rocky with us to studio visits where he could sniff out their ideas in more detail.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRocky has a curious nature that has made him a great curating partner. He developed a rapport with the artists and together we had a dialog to determine which works would be most suitable for exhibition. The process has been really fun and illuminating for us and that’s what we hope to bring to the public in this exhibition.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What approach did the artists take to creating work for dogs?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAll of the artists are excited to frame ideas from their existing practice for a new audience and have been considering dogs’ unique points of view and perception. There will be work about the emotional issues dogs face — <a href="https://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>, which is common — as well as work that speaks to dogs’ interest in certain color schemes (they can see blue, yellow and grey). Works exploring formal, conceptual, and relational issues will be executed in a variety of media from sound and sculpture to kibble and squeaky toys.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBroadly, we know that canines perceive the world in unique ways. Olfaction is essential to their understanding, the color spectrum they see is different from a human’s, and of course they live closer to the ground. They’re also fearless and willing to engage with work in a variety of different ways, like sniffing, peeing, and licking. We expect a really diverse range of interactions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThat said, we hesitate to speak too broadly for an entire species. Just like humans, individual dogs have different attractions and aversions so we are intentionally presenting works that address a variety of aesthetic and conceptual concerns. Some artists are interested in specifics of a dog’s physical perspective or perceptual abilities, while others are more concerned with emotional connections.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe look forward to learning from the show. Will hounds react differently than terriers? Dachshunds vs Dobermans? Each piece of artwork addresses canine viewers differently, so the whole show is an experiment for both the curators and the artists.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you hope visitors will take away from the exhibit?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\ndOGUMENTA offers both the chance for humans to get to know their canine friends better and also the opportunity to approach art differently themselves. Attendees will gain new insights into their companion’s personality and character. It’s an opportunity for bonding and learning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is the biggest lesson dogs have taught you about art?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGo with your gut!

They do everything together.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your favorite part of being a mom?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s ALL amazing. I couldn’t be happier. But the best part is waking her up every morning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How has your view of health changed since having Ruby?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSince having Ruby, we are constantly cooking at home. We’re always trying new things to find out what Ruby likes, which has made us <em>all</em> more health conscious!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What does a typical healthy day look like for you, Dylan, and Ruby? Are there special activities that the three of you share?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan, Ruby, and I have a morning ritual! The three of us take a walk to get coffee, and if the weather is really nice we’ll walk into SoHo for breakfast. I’m also lucky enough to work from my home office, so I can be with them all the time!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="http://instagram.com/somethingnavy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@somethingnavy</a></em>', 'Customer Spotlight: Arielle Charnas', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'customer-spotlight-arielle-charnas-2', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:44:09', '2018-04-09 09:44:09', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=206', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Kai, my 95-pound Dogo Argentino “lap dog” who thinks she’s the size of a chihuahua, has just about every allergy under the sun. No wheat or grains. Absolutely no chicken. Heck, it cost me $1,000 at the dog <em>dermatologist</em> to determine she’s also allergic to the sun. So, yeah, I’m a bit crazy, especially when we’re out and a well-intentioned, dog-loving person offers Kai a treat, which is bound to make her have diarrhea for a week — and/or give her a gnarly rash.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo, you can see why I jumped at the chance to try <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, a food delivery service for our four-legged friends that features <em>real</em> food (tested on humans!), created with board-certified veterinary nutritionists, and is customized to fit individual dog’s needs. It’s great for all dogs, but especially the ones with those special dietary needs like Kai. And after I’ve switched her food countless times, I was so excited to try something new that didn’t involve randomly picking a new “hypo-allergenic” dog food off a shelf at the pet store.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInstead, here’s how The Farmer’s Dog works: You fill out an <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/#signup-box">online questionnaire</a> about your dog’s size, weight, activity level, protein preference (turkey, beef, or pork) etc., then you’ll get back a customized food plan that’s delivered to you every two weeks in pre-portioned packets. You keep 5 at a time in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer (you might have to clear out some of your frozen pizza stash to make room, but you’ll survive). Then you simply feed your pup one of the packets from the fridge at breakfast and one at dinner and you’re done! There’s no measuring or hassle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKai could hardly contain herself when I received the first shipment of food and now that we’re 2 weeks into her new food regimen, there’s no way she’ll settle for kibble again.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are three awesome things that happened in the first two weeks of using The Farmer’s Dog:\r\n<h4><strong>1. My Dog’s Allergies Got SO Much Better</strong></h4>\r\nHow do I know when Kai’s allergies are bad? The easiest sign is that the hair on her head gets splotchy (see photos below). Within a week of eating The Farmer’s Dog food, the area looked significantly better. She wasn’t itchy at all and the sensitive skin on her belly returned to the normal pink color, instead of reddish and irritated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd TMI alert — her poop looked better than ever. Believe me, it’s easy to tell when you have a 95-pound dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Farmer’s Dog food is shipped to you within days of being made in human-grade kitchens in New York and you won’t believe the difference in how it looks and smells compared to the stuff you’ve been feeding your dog. At this point, Kai is probably eating better than I am…\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>2. She LOVES Eating</strong></h4>\r\nKai already loved to eat, but she was next-level excited for mealtime these last few weeks. Even if she was sound asleep on the couch before dinner, all I had to do was walk to the fridge, take out a packet, and start to pour it in her bowl and she would spring into action — with a giant string of drool hanging out of her mouth as she waited. She never reacted like that to her previous kibble dinner. No way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome nights she’d even eat all of her food then return a few minutes later to her bowl and lick it again — just to make sure she hadn’t missed a piece.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>3. I Felt Good About Feeding Her</strong></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter trying out The Farmer’s Dog, I realized I was a crazy and also <strong>lazy</strong> dog mom. After so many failed attempts at finding the right food for her allergy needs, I stuck with a kibble that was fine but not great. I didn’t really think there was anything better out there. She wasn’t itchy or in pain with her old food (I’m not <em>that</em> bad), but after seeing the improvement with The Farmer’s Dog, it was very apparent that there was something soo much better for her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, let’s be honest: her new food plan is more expensive than her kibble (cost per week varies according to the size and needs of your dog, but plans start at about $29 a week), but my dog and her health are 100% worth it. I’ll eat out one fewer time a month or ditch that afternoon Starbucks and quickly find the extra money to keep my furry BFF happy and, most importantly, healthy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images:  </em><a href="http://www.livingly.com/team/Deena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deena Bustillo </a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'My Dog Has Terrible Allergies and This Meal Service Changed All That', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'my-dog-has-terrible-allergies-and-this-meal-service-changed-all-that-2__trashed', '', '', '2018-04-10 14:28:28', '2018-04-10 14:28:28', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=208', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(210, 1, '2018-03-30 08:15:38', '2018-03-30 08:15:38', 'There’s a common misconception that if you aren’t ready to<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-rescue-runways-guide-to-adopting-a-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> adopt a dog</a>, you can’t help a homeless pet. While adoption is one of the biggest ways to make an impact, it’s certainly not the only one. Here are a few creative ways you can get involved and make a real difference in the lives of rescue pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Foster</h5>\r\nMany people can’t commit to a permanent adoption due to busy schedules, traveling, or expenses. Holding off on adopting is a responsible decision when you know you can’t care for an animal long-term, but if you have a two or four week opening on your calendar, fostering might be for you. Plenty of local rescues need foster homes for animals, and sometimes organizations will even pay for all the expenses as long as you can provide love and shelter. It might be hard to say goodbye at the end of the foster stay, but remember that you’ve helped free up space for that organization to take in even more animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Volunteer</h5>\r\nWalk into any shelter and ask if they need help and you’ll be hard pressed to find one that will turn you down. It takes a village to run any nonprofit and when you have animals that need to be cared for, it’s that much more important to have volunteers. Whether you’re looking to help with marketing, fundraising, or simply want to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-importance-of-letting-your-dog-sniff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk dogs</a>, your skill set and time will be put to good use.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Educate</h5>\r\nSo you’re allergic to anything with four legs but still want to help in the plight to save animals. Become an educator! Often times, rescues already have some sort of program in place to educate the community about helping their local pet population. You can go to schools, religious organizations, or businesses and host a discussion on spay/neuter, how to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dangerous-items-dogs-hiding-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">care for pets</a>, and why adoption is important. Education is one of the most powerful tools in the fight against homelessness for pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Fundraise</h5>\r\nIf you like to host events or plan parties, consider organizing a fundraiser for your local shelter. It can be as simple as a bake sale or as extravagant as a gala; anything you can contribute will be an asset. Partner with a local boutique for a Shop Your Cause event, or ask your gym to host a workout fundraiser. Get creative with it and do something that you enjoy. In the end, your local shelter will appreciate whatever amount you raise.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Donate</h5>\r\nIf you’re short on time and resources, skip that latte and donate $5 to a rescue of your choice instead. If you want to make a more direct impact, many organizations have a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/hurricane-harvey-how-to-help/">wish list</a> of items they need. You can usually find these lists under the donations tab on their website, or you can reach out to them directly and ask. Whether you can gift a blanket or a month’s supply of heart worm medication, your donation will help an animal in need.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@butterandwilson</a></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Here’s How to Help Homeless Dogs Without Adopting', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'heres-how-to-help-homeless-dogs-without-adopting', '', '', '2018-04-09 12:32:33', '2018-04-09 12:32:33', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=210', 0, 'post', '', 0),

While adoption is one of the biggest ways to make an impact, it’s certainly not the only one. Here are a few creative ways you can get involved and make a real difference in the lives of rescue pets.\n<h4>Foster</h4>\nMany people can’t commit to a permanent adoption due to busy schedules, traveling, or expenses. Holding off on adopting is a responsible decision when you know you can’t care for an animal long-term, but if you have a two or four week opening on your calendar, fostering might be for you. Plenty of local rescues need foster homes for animals, and sometimes organizations will even pay for all the expenses as long as you can provide love and shelter. It might be hard to say goodbye at the end of the foster stay, but remember that you’ve helped free up space for that organization to take in even more animals.\n<h4>Volunteer</h4>\nWalk into any shelter and ask if they need help and you’ll be hard pressed to find one that will turn you down. It takes a village to run any nonprofit and when you have animals that need to be cared for, it’s that much more important to have volunteers. Whether you’re looking to help with marketing, fundraising, or simply want to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-importance-of-letting-your-dog-sniff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk dogs</a>, your skill set and time will be put to good use.\n<h5>Educate</h5>\nSo you’re allergic to anything with four legs but still want to help in the plight to save animals. Become an educator! Often times, rescues already have some sort of program in place to educate the community about helping their local pet population. You can go to schools, religious organizations, or businesses and host a discussion on spay/neuter, how to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dangerous-items-dogs-hiding-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">care for pets</a>, and why adoption is important. Education is one of the most powerful tools in the fight against homelessness for pets.\n<h5>Fundraise</h5>\nIf you like to host events or plan parties, consider organizing a fundraiser for your local shelter. It can be as simple as a bake sale or as extravagant as a gala; anything you can contribute will be an asset. Partner with a local boutique for a Shop Your Cause event, or ask your gym to host a workout fundraiser. Get creative with it and do something that you enjoy. In the end, your local shelter will appreciate whatever amount you raise.\n<h5>Donate</h5>\nIf you’re short on time and resources, skip that latte and donate $5 to a rescue of your choice instead. If you want to make a more direct impact, many organizations have a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/hurricane-harvey-how-to-help/">wish list</a> of items they need. You can usually find these lists under the donations tab on their website, or you can reach out to them directly and ask. Whether you can gift a blanket or a month’s supply of heart worm medication, your donation will help an animal in need.\n\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@butterandwilson</a></em>\n\n&nbsp;', 'Here’s How to Help Homeless Dogs Without Adopting', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '210-autosave-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:45:58', '2018-04-09 08:45:58', '', 210, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/210-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Kai, my 95-pound Dogo Argentino “lap dog” who thinks she’s the size of a chihuahua, has just about every allergy under the sun. No wheat or grains. Absolutely no chicken. Heck, it cost me $1,000 at the dog <em>dermatologist</em> to determine she’s also allergic to the sun. So, yeah, I’m a bit crazy, especially when we’re out and a well-intentioned, dog-loving person offers Kai a treat, which is bound to make her have diarrhea for a week — and/or give her a gnarly rash.\r\n\r\nSo, you can see why I jumped at the chance to try <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, a food delivery service for our four-legged friends that features <em>real</em> food (tested on humans!), created with board-certified veterinary nutritionists, and is customized to fit individual dog’s needs. It’s great for all dogs, but especially the ones with those special dietary needs like Kai. And after I’ve switched her food countless times, I was so excited to try something new that didn’t involve randomly picking a new “hypo-allergenic” dog food off a shelf at the pet store.\r\n\r\nInstead, here’s how The Farmer’s Dog works: You fill out an <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/#signup-box">online questionnaire</a> about your dog’s size, weight, activity level, protein preference (turkey, beef, or pork) etc., then you’ll get back a customized food plan that’s delivered to you every two weeks in pre-portioned packets. You keep 5 at a time in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer (you might have to clear out some of your frozen pizza stash to make room, but you’ll survive). Then you simply feed your pup one of the packets from the fridge at breakfast and one at dinner and you’re done! There’s no measuring or hassle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKai could hardly contain herself when I received the first shipment of food and now that we’re 2 weeks into her new food regimen, there’s no way she’ll settle for kibble again.\r\n\r\nHere are three awesome things that happened in the first two weeks of using The Farmer’s Dog:\r\n<h4><strong>1. My Dog’s Allergies Got SO Much Better</strong></h4>\r\nHow do I know when Kai’s allergies are bad? The easiest sign is that the hair on her head gets splotchy (see photos below). Within a week of eating The Farmer’s Dog food, the area looked significantly better. She wasn’t itchy at all and the sensitive skin on her belly returned to the normal pink color, instead of reddish and irritated.\r\n\r\nAnd TMI alert — her poop looked better than ever. Believe me, it’s easy to tell when you have a 95-pound dog.\r\n\r\nThe Farmer’s Dog food is shipped to you within days of being made in human-grade kitchens in New York and you won’t believe the difference in how it looks and smells compared to the stuff you’ve been feeding your dog. At this point, Kai is probably eating better than I am…\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>2. She LOVES Eating</strong></h4>\r\nKai already loved to eat, but she was next-level excited for mealtime these last few weeks. Even if she was sound asleep on the couch before dinner, all I had to do was walk to the fridge, take out a packet, and start to pour it in her bowl and she would spring into action — with a giant string of drool hanging out of her mouth as she waited. She never reacted like that to her previous kibble dinner. No way.\r\n\r\nSome nights she’d even eat all of her food then return a few minutes later to her bowl and lick it again — just to make sure she hadn’t missed a piece.\r\n<h4><strong>3. I Felt Good About Feeding Her</strong></h4>\r\nAfter trying out The Farmer’s Dog, I realized I was a crazy and also <strong>lazy</strong> dog mom. After so many failed attempts at finding the right food for her allergy needs, I stuck with a kibble that was fine but not great. I didn’t really think there was anything better out there. She wasn’t itchy or in pain with her old food (I’m not <em>that</em> bad), but after seeing the improvement with The Farmer’s Dog, it was very apparent that there was something soo much better for her.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, let’s be honest: her new food plan is more expensive than her kibble (cost per week varies according to the size and needs of your dog, but plans start at about $29 a week), but my dog and her health are 100% worth it. I’ll eat out one fewer time a month or ditch that afternoon Starbucks and quickly find the extra money to keep my furry BFF happy and, most importantly, healthy.\r\n\r\n<em>Images:  </em><a href="http://www.livingly.com/team/Deena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deena Bustillo </a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'My Dog Has Terrible Allergies and This Meal Service Changed All That', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '208-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:23:58', '2018-04-09 08:23:58', '', 208, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/208-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This is why we’re supporting <a href="https://www.sthuberts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Hubert’s Animal Welfare Center</a>, the New Jersey-based organization that mobilized to welcome <a href="https://www.sthuberts.org/blog/2017/8/28/northeast-shelters-mobilize-to-help-harvey-impacted-areas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">78 shelter dogs</a> from Texas this week. As with any sentient being, being displaced can cause many issues in dogs ranging from anxiety to a loss of appetite, which can lead to future health issues. That’s why we’re donating our nourishing, fresh meals to rescued dogs in need.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How can you help?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFood is only half the battle. Caring for a new batch of confused shelter dogs also requires a lot of love, patience, and supplies. This week, we’re hosting <a href="http://thefarmers.dog/2vIv5Nj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog Harvey Relief Drive</a> to help St. Hubert’s. Simply browse our list of suggested items, ship your donation to us, and we’ll bring everything directly to St. Hubert’s next weekend and meet the dogs we’re helping together. Products that can help make a difference range between $5 and $30.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe know you love dogs as much as we do; let’s work together to keep them healthy, happy, and safe.

This summer, <a href="http://www.dogumenta.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dOGUMENTA (I) NYC</a> is offering pet owners (and lovers) a new opportunity to connect and experience visual art with their dogs. We sat down with founding curator Jessica Dawson to talk about the inspiration behind the exhibit and the biggest lesson dogs can teach us about art.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What inspired the launch of dOGUMENTA?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe project was inspired by my gallery visits with my rescue dog Rocky, whose insights inspired the Dogumenta manifesto “<a href="http://www.dogumenta.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 Things My Dog Taught Me About Art</a>.” I delivered the manifesto at a gallery in Brooklyn last year and felt that it was time for canines to have an art show all their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How did you begin curating the exhibit? What kind of visual artists did you want to include?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce we found our venue partner (Brookfield Place in New York), we started hounding artists whose work we found interesting. All of the artists we’re featuring in the show responded immediately to the concept and understood how it operated on multiple levels at once. Mica Scalin (my creative development consultant and partner) and I vetted their capabilities, and then we brought Rocky with us to studio visits where he could sniff out their ideas in more detail.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRocky has a curious nature that has made him a great curating partner. He developed a rapport with the artists and together we had a dialog to determine which works would be most suitable for exhibition. The process has been really fun and illuminating for us and that’s what we hope to bring to the public in this exhibition.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What approach did the artists take to creating work for dogs?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAll of the artists are excited to frame ideas from their existing practice for a new audience and have been considering dogs’ unique points of view and perception. There will be work about the emotional issues dogs face — <a href="https://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>, which is common — as well as work that speaks to dogs’ interest in certain color schemes (they can see blue, yellow and grey). Works exploring formal, conceptual, and relational issues will be executed in a variety of media from sound and sculpture to kibble and squeaky toys.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBroadly, we know that canines perceive the world in unique ways. Olfaction is essential to their understanding, the color spectrum they see is different from a human’s, and of course they live closer to the ground. They’re also fearless and willing to engage with work in a variety of different ways, like sniffing, peeing, and licking. We expect a really diverse range of interactions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThat said, we hesitate to speak too broadly for an entire species. Just like humans, individual dogs have different attractions and aversions so we are intentionally presenting works that address a variety of aesthetic and conceptual concerns. Some artists are interested in specifics of a dog’s physical perspective or perceptual abilities, while others are more concerned with emotional connections.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe look forward to learning from the show. Will hounds react differently than terriers? Dachshunds vs Dobermans? Each piece of artwork addresses canine viewers differently, so the whole show is an experiment for both the curators and the artists.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you hope visitors will take away from the exhibit?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\ndOGUMENTA offers both the chance for humans to get to know their canine friends better and also the opportunity to approach art differently themselves. Attendees will gain new insights into their companion’s personality and character. It’s an opportunity for bonding and learning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is the biggest lesson dogs have taught you about art?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGo with your gut! Being fearless in the face of art is Rocky’s greatest lesson.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: Jason Falchook</em>', 'Introducing dOGUMENTA, the First Art Show for Dogs', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '202-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:30:16', '2018-04-09 08:30:16', '', 202, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/202-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Unfortunately, my stint as a pre-vet student didn’t last very long after I fainted in my dissection class, so I’ve had to find other ways to help animals.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Chicago-based animal lover spent years volunteering at shelters, and found a new way to make her mark when she created <a href="https://www.therescuerunway.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rescue Runway</a> in February 2017. The popular blog marries her love of animals and fashion by chronicling trips to local shelters and including information on both her outfits and the pictured pups in need of homes. Whenever possible, she tries to wear clothing brands that support and donate proceeds to animal organizations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHer idea has resonated with dog lovers and fashion enthusiasts alike. Within months of its launch, The Rescue Runway was featured in <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/pets/ct-chicago-fashion-blog-shelter-dogs-20170616-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Chicago Tribune</a> and received praise from fashion designer and blogger <a href="https://laurenconrad.com/blog/2017/07/lc-com-edit-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Conrad.</a> “I will never charge shelters for my “services,” so I am constantly looking for ways to partner with like-minded brands who are interested in making a fashionable social statement,” Christine shared with <em>the Digest. </em>“The goal is to make The Rescue Runway my full-time job within the next two years.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe caught up with Christine to talk dogs, blogs, and the biggest lesson animals have taught her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How was the idea for The Rescue Runway born? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI’ve always been an active volunteer at animal shelters in and around Chicago and wanted to find a way to promote adoption to a new audience. I follow many fashion bloggers and love when they share pictures of their pups, and one day I had a light bulb moment. I realized my passion for clothes could be combined with my love of equally adorable dogs (and cats!) in a new kind of fashion blog. A blog that not only shows off fun outfits, but also has a purpose behind it that people can connect with.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>You do a lot of work to raise awareness about homeless pets in Chicago. What has the response from your community been like? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo say it’s been amazing would be an understatement. Since day one, people have reached out from across the city and country telling me how wonderful of a platform this is for the rescue world. I’ve been lucky to meet some pretty incredible people in Chicago who are just as passionate about adoption as I am, and everyone has been so supportive and offered advice along the way. One of my new blogger friends just adopted her first pup and let me know that my blog helped her make the decision!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’ve written about your exploration of the </strong><a href="https://www.therescuerunway.com/single-post/kibbles-and-bits-of-everything" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.therescuerunway.com/single-post/kibbles-and-bits-of-everything&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1501617677812000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIECAyAK7qnfpy4E6X-AZHVlQYIQ"><strong>pet food industry</strong></a><strong> and your experience trying a fresh diet for your dogs Hattrick and Stanley. What’s your approach to feeding them these days? </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWriting that post was quite the eye-opener and it’s completely changed my approach to feeding my pets. Hattrick and Stanley are both working on their summer bodies and were in need of a leaner diet. Luckily, <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a> provided well-balanced meals to kick-start their weight loss goals. I’m happy to report that Stanley has lost five pounds and Hattrick is down three! I’m hoping to switch them to a total human-grade diet by the end of the year, and for now they’re eating a combination of The Farmer’s Dog and a zero-grain dog food to shave off a few more pounds!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is it about animals that makes them so special to you? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI will always be in awe of the unconditional and innocent love that animals possess. Some of my favorite dogs have been the ones who were treated so badly before being saved and are still the sweetest pups and have so much love to give. We can all learn a lesson from them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you hope people learn from visiting The Rescue Runway? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy blog is full of educational posts about things that are all important to me, but I hope the number one takeaway is just how amazing adopting a pet can be. People don’t often realize that you can rescue almost any kind of dog. Big, little, purebred or mutt, the perfect pup is out there waiting for you. It may take a little research, but I promise it’s worth it. I hear from followers all the time that in the end, it’s really the dog that rescues the person.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/therescuerunway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rescue Runway</a>', 'How One Fashion Blogger is Giving Shelter Dogs a Voice', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '200-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:31:40', '2018-04-09 08:31:40', '', 200, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/200-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We had seen this litter of English Retriever puppies and fell in love with two of them. Every day for three months I kept asking my fiancé (now husband) if we could get them. We were really debating it, though, because it’s such a huge responsibility. I’m pregnant, we were planning our wedding, we both work at startups…there’s always a lot going on!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFinally, I talked to my dad about it and he told me to follow my heart and get them. I was inspired by him, so on New Year’s Eve, instead of going to this party we had tickets to, we drove to Long Beach and picked up Rocky and Apollo. We’ve never been happier! Obviously, it was the right decision and we adore them. They’re really good puppies; they understand “no,” they haven’t torn a lot up in our house, and they’re housebroken. We’ve been really lucky in that regard.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>How did you choose a pet food when you first got your pups? What was your main criteria in selecting a food? </b>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy husband and I eat healthy and are conscious of the food we put in our bodies, and we try to do the same for our dogs. I had initially thought that certain dry food brands might be a good option compared to the more mainstream ones, because it seemed like they didn’t have a lot of gross stuff in there. After doing a little bit more research, though, I learned that it was mostly marketing and that a lot of dry food is pretty much the same.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen we discovered <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, and the dogs go so crazy for it.

There’s always one or two chickpeas that get caught in the maze and they end up flipping over their bowls to get to them! They just love the food.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Did you notice any changes in Rocky and Apollo when you switched them to a fresh food diet?</b>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat people notice on our dogs is that their fur is super silky. It’s gorgeous and so thick and soft! I would say an improvement in fur is one big thing. They’re very happy and super healthy all around, and I’m sure the food has a lot to do with that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>How has switching to fresh food changed the way you think about their nutrition?</b><b> </b>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think people should just think about it the same way they think about feeding themselves. Would you eat Lucky Charms for every meal, every day? Probably not. Our dogs are living, breathing creatures and require real nutrients. The quality of the nutrients we get from fresh foods like vegetables and meat is so much higher than it would be in processed food.

An associate veterinarian at the Belle Haven Animal Medical Centre in Virginia and expert in animal health and nutrition, she is also the host and executive producer of <a href="http://www.thepetshow.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Pet Show with Dr. Katy</em></a>. Dr. Katy has been featured on the TODAY Show, Fox &amp; Friends, NPR, CNBC, The Meredith Vieira Show, and HuffPost Live, among others.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe sat down with Dr. Katy to talk about the importance of choosing the right diet for your dog, the advice she would give every aspiring vet, and why she’s dedicated her life to animals.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Tell us a little bit about your career path. When did you first know you wanted to be a veterinarian?</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI grew up in South Louisiana and animals were always a huge part of my life. You name it, we had it — chickens, cows, even the occasional rabbit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy dad’s best friend was a veterinarian when I was growing up, and one summer in college he told me about a job opening at a small local zoo. I was pre-med at the time, but I went and worked and a six week position turned into 13 weeks. I absolutely loved it and thought, “This is it. This is what I want to do.” I went back to school that fall and changed my major to a pre-vet track. Two years after that, I went to Louisiana State University’s School of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What’s one piece of advice you would give to someone who wants to become a vet?</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think the biggest mistake people make when they go into veterinary medicine is thinking, “I don’t want to work with people; I just want to work with animals!” One of the biggest parts of our job is actually people relations. Like pediatricians, we have patients who can’t talk and can’t tell us where it hurts, and we have very concerned parents advocating for them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy biggest piece of advice for someone who wants to be a veterinarian is to take psychology, economics, and business classes. Having interpersonal communication skills and being business savvy is a big part of being a really good vet. Vets are highly intelligent people with big hearts, but most of them are also small business owners and there actually isn’t any business training in veterinary school.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOnce you make the decision that being a vet is what you want, dive in and study hard. It ain’t easy!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>You’re very vocal about the importance of nutrition for dogs. How big of an impact do you think food has on our dogs’ health and well-being?</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs a mom, I’ve really delved hard into thinking about what I’m putting in my kids’ bodies. We all put so much time and interest into what we’re eating because we know it has an impact. We are what we eat, and the same thing goes for our pets.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf we’re feeding our pets protein that is so highly processed it’s lost all of its nutritional integrity, we’re not doing them any favors. It’s certainly cheaper in the moment, but it’s actually not cheaper in the long run when you consider that poor diet can cause diseases and health issues like diabetes down the line. If we start with good nutrition from day one, we have a heck of a better chance of our pets living long and healthy lives.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What advice do you give pet owners who are trying to choose the best food for their dog?</strong><b>\n</b>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA lot of pet health really has to do with choosing the right food for your dog. People think they’re feeding their dog really wonderful food because they’ve read a review online, or the 19-year-old restocking the shelves at the local pet store told them it was a great brand. What you really need to do is have a conversation with your vet. Your vet is going to be able to better assess your pet’s lifestyle and caloric needs and help you figure it all out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat really impresses me so much about <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a> is that you guys are doing what I’ve been telling people to do for years. You’ve got the algorithms in place to account for lifestyle, disease, body condition, etc. and feed dogs accordingly. Pet owners need to figure out the right daily calorie count for their dogs and stick to it, remembering that treats are extra on top of that. I think one of the hardest things is for people to be honest about that. Sometimes it’s just easier not to think about it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What are some of the biggest health issues our pets are facing today? How can pet owners protect their dogs?</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think the biggest epidemic we’re seeing in pets is definitely obesity. Almost 60% of American dogs are overweight or obese. That’s shocking!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe obesity issue stems from a lack of nutritional education and a lack of being able to recognize pet obesity by owners. In a study conducted by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention (APOP), pet owners were surveyed about their dogs’ weights. 100% of the dogs included in the study were considered obese, yet <em>90% of the owners</em> <em>polled</em> said their dogs were a normal weight!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPeople are completely in denial about what is and isn’t a healthy weight for their pets, but we have to start being realistic and treating pet obesity as seriously as we treat other health issues like thyroid conditions, heart disease and even cancer. We have the science to prove that pets who weigh less live longer, and we all want to give our dogs the longest, happiest lives possible. A massive part of that is nutrition. When we’re feeding our dogs good things, it translates to good health.\n\nMy biggest piece of advice would be to talk with your vet and not take it personally if they tell you that your dog is overweight. Obesity is a diagnosis of a disease, not something to get offended over. They’re not saying <i>you’re</i> a bad pet owner, they’re saying your pet has a disease and it’s one you can treat and work on together as a team. If you look at it that way, you’ll have a lot more results than if you get defensive about what you’re feeding or how much exercise your dog is getting.\n\n<em> </em>\n\n<strong>Such important advice. Lastly, from one crazy dog lover to another, what do you think it is about dogs that makes them so special?</strong>\n\nWhat I think is really cool is that in the last couple of years, even the Pope has spoken out about animals having souls. I think that’s something that we have known for years as dog owners. I know that when I look into my dog’s eyes there is a soul in there and a sentient being who loves me unconditionally, the way that I love him. It’s been validating that there have been so many books published over the last few years about how dogs touch our souls and communicate with us.\n\nIt’s easy to connect with a dog, soul to soul. There are no pretenses and you don’t need makeup or your best clothes. Dogs aren’t going to judge you; they just love you. I think everyone’s goal is to find that unconditional love in life, and whether or not we find it in another human, we know our dogs love us unconditionally.

An associate veterinarian at the Belle Haven Animal Medical Centre in Virginia and expert in animal health and nutrition, she is also the host and executive producer of <a href="http://www.thepetshow.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Pet Show with Dr. Katy</em></a>. Dr. Katy has been featured on the TODAY Show, Fox &amp; Friends, NPR, CNBC, The Meredith Vieira Show, and HuffPost Live, among others.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe sat down with Dr. Katy to talk about the importance of choosing the right diet for your dog, the advice she would give every aspiring vet, and why she’s dedicated her life to animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Tell us a little bit about your career path. When did you first know you wanted to be a veterinarian?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI grew up in South Louisiana and animals were always a huge part of my life. You name it, we had it — chickens, cows, even the occasional rabbit.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy dad’s best friend was a veterinarian when I was growing up, and one summer in college he told me about a job opening at a small local zoo. I was pre-med at the time, but I went and worked and a six week position turned into 13 weeks. I absolutely loved it and thought, “This is it. This is what I want to do.” I went back to school that fall and changed my major to a pre-vet track. Two years after that, I went to Louisiana State University’s School of Veterinary Medicine.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s one piece of advice you would give to someone who wants to become a vet?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think the biggest mistake people make when they go into veterinary medicine is thinking, “I don’t want to work with people; I just want to work with animals!” One of the biggest parts of our job is actually people relations. Like pediatricians, we have patients who can’t talk and can’t tell us where it hurts, and we have very concerned parents advocating for them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy biggest piece of advice for someone who wants to be a veterinarian is to take psychology, economics, and business classes. Having interpersonal communication skills and being business savvy is a big part of being a really good vet. Vets are highly intelligent people with big hearts, but most of them are also small business owners and there actually isn’t any business training in veterinary school.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce you make the decision that being a vet is what you want, dive in and study hard. It ain’t easy!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’re very vocal about the importance of nutrition for dogs. How big of an impact do you think food has on our dogs’ health and well-being?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs a mom, I’ve really delved hard into thinking about what I’m putting in my kids’ bodies. We all put so much time and interest into what we’re eating because we know it has an impact. We are what we eat, and the same thing goes for our pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf we’re feeding our pets protein that is so highly processed it’s lost all of its nutritional integrity, we’re not doing them any favors. It’s certainly cheaper in the moment, but it’s actually not cheaper in the long run when you consider that poor diet can cause diseases and health issues like diabetes down the line. If we start with good nutrition from day one, we have a heck of a better chance of our pets living long and healthy lives.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What advice do you give pet owners who are trying to choose the best food for their dog?</strong><b>\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA lot of pet health really has to do with choosing the right food for your dog. People think they’re feeding their dog really wonderful food because they’ve read a review online, or the 19-year-old restocking the shelves at the local pet store told them it was a great brand. What you really need to do is have a conversation with your vet. Your vet is going to be able to better assess your pet’s lifestyle and caloric needs and help you figure it all out.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat really impresses me so much about <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a> is that you guys are doing what I’ve been telling people to do for years. You’ve got the algorithms in place to account for lifestyle, disease, body condition, etc. and feed dogs accordingly. Pet owners need to figure out the right daily calorie count for their dogs and stick to it, remembering that treats are extra on top of that. I think one of the hardest things is for people to be honest about that. Sometimes it’s just easier not to think about it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What are some of the biggest health issues our pets are facing today?

Kai, my 95-pound Dogo Argentino “lap dog” who thinks she’s the size of a chihuahua, has just about every allergy under the sun. No wheat or grains. Absolutely no chicken. Heck, it cost me $1,000 at the dog <em>dermatologist</em> to determine she’s also allergic to the sun. So, yeah, I’m a bit crazy, especially when we’re out and a well-intentioned, dog-loving person offers Kai a treat, which is bound to make her have diarrhea for a week — and/or give her a gnarly rash.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo, you can see why I jumped at the chance to try <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, a food delivery service for our four-legged friends that features <em>real</em> food (tested on humans!), created with board-certified veterinary nutritionists, and is customized to fit individual dog’s needs. It’s great for all dogs, but especially the ones with those special dietary needs like Kai. And after I’ve switched her food countless times, I was so excited to try something new that didn’t involve randomly picking a new “hypo-allergenic” dog food off a shelf at the pet store.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInstead, here’s how The Farmer’s Dog works: You fill out an <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/#signup-box">online questionnaire</a> about your dog’s size, weight, activity level, protein preference (turkey, beef, or pork) etc., then you’ll get back a customized food plan that’s delivered to you every two weeks in pre-portioned packets. You keep 5 at a time in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer (you might have to clear out some of your frozen pizza stash to make room, but you’ll survive). Then you simply feed your pup one of the packets from the fridge at breakfast and one at dinner and you’re done! There’s no measuring or hassle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKai could hardly contain herself when I received the first shipment of food and now that we’re 2 weeks into her new food regimen, there’s no way she’ll settle for kibble again.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are three awesome things that happened in the first two weeks of using The Farmer’s Dog:\r\n<h4><strong>1. My Dog’s Allergies Got SO Much Better</strong></h4>\r\nHow do I know when Kai’s allergies are bad? The easiest sign is that the hair on her head gets splotchy (see photos below). Within a week of eating The Farmer’s Dog food, the area looked significantly better. She wasn’t itchy at all and the sensitive skin on her belly returned to the normal pink color, instead of reddish and irritated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd TMI alert — her poop looked better than ever. Believe me, it’s easy to tell when you have a 95-pound dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Farmer’s Dog food is shipped to you within days of being made in human-grade kitchens in New York and you won’t believe the difference in how it looks and smells compared to the stuff you’ve been feeding your dog. At this point, Kai is probably eating better than I am…\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>2. She LOVES Eating</strong></h4>\r\nKai already loved to eat, but she was next-level excited for mealtime these last few weeks. Even if she was sound asleep on the couch before dinner, all I had to do was walk to the fridge, take out a packet, and start to pour it in her bowl and she would spring into action — with a giant string of drool hanging out of her mouth as she waited. She never reacted like that to her previous kibble dinner. No way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome nights she’d even eat all of her food then return a few minutes later to her bowl and lick it again — just to make sure she hadn’t missed a piece.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>3. I Felt Good About Feeding Her</strong></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter trying out The Farmer’s Dog, I realized I was a crazy and also <strong>lazy</strong> dog mom. After so many failed attempts at finding the right food for her allergy needs, I stuck with a kibble that was fine but not great. I didn’t really think there was anything better out there. She wasn’t itchy or in pain with her old food (I’m not <em>that</em> bad), but after seeing the improvement with The Farmer’s Dog, it was very apparent that there was something soo much better for her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, let’s be honest: her new food plan is more expensive than her kibble (cost per week varies according to the size and needs of your dog, but plans start at about $29 a week), but my dog and her health are 100% worth it. I’ll eat out one fewer time a month or ditch that afternoon Starbucks and quickly find the extra money to keep my furry BFF happy and, most importantly, healthy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images:  </em><a href="http://www.livingly.com/team/Deena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deena Bustillo </a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'My Dog Has Terrible Allergies and This Meal Service Changed All That', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '194-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:36:48', '2018-04-09 08:36:48', '', 194, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/194-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

When she isn’t collaborating with athleisure brands like Bandier or developing her own fashion line, Arielle soaks up quality time with her 1-year-old daughter, Ruby Lou. Instagram followers can’t get enough of the mother-daughter duo, and Arielle’s feed is full of candid videos of the pair sharing dance parties, watching their favorite movies, and eating home cooked meals together. We caught up with the powerhouse NYC mom about her dog, Dylan, and her favorite morning rituals with her family.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>When did you first become a dog mom? Tell us a little bit about Dylan and what makes your relationship special.</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI got Dylan 5 years ago with my boyfriend (now husband) as our first dog together. We had met another dog that we thought we wanted, but once we met Dylan we knew he was meant to be part of our family. Dylan is so special to us because he was my first “born.” He started our family, which has now grown into four along with his baby sister, Ruby.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How do you prioritize Dylan’s health in your daily routine? </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan’s health has always been very important to us and we always thought we were giving him the best. He wound up developing HGE and was in hospitals on and off, and we tried so many different brands of food. We thankfully found <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Farmer’s Dog</a> and that has been a game changer!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’re also mom to a beautiful baby girl named Ruby! How did you prepare Dylan for the transition of having a new baby in the house?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen we first had Ruby, we took her blanket from the hospital and put it in Dylan’s bed so he could get familiar with her scent. At first we were very cautious because we didn’t know how he would adjust to a new family member. Now Ruby can’t get enough of him and they are best friends! They love watching <em>The Secret Life of Pets</em> together. They do everything together.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your favorite part of being a mom?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s ALL amazing. I couldn’t be happier. But the best part is waking her up every morning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How has your view of health changed since having Ruby?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSince having Ruby, we are constantly cooking at home. We’re always trying new things to find out what Ruby likes, which has made us <em>all</em> more health conscious!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What does a typical healthy day look like for you, Dylan, and Ruby? Are there special activities that the three of you share?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan, Ruby, and I have a morning ritual! The three of us take a walk to get coffee, and if the weather is really nice we’ll walk into SoHo for breakfast. I’m also lucky enough to work from my home office, so I can be with them all the time!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="http://instagram.com/somethingnavy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@somethingnavy</a></em>', 'Customer Spotlight: Arielle Charnas', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '192-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:37:28', '2018-04-09 08:37:28', '', 192, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/192-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I majored in English.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDon’t believe me? Over the next few months we’ll be interviewing people from a variety of cities and industries about how bringing their working dogs to the office has impacted their lives, careers, and mental health. But first, a word from science.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Benefits of dogs in the workplace:</h4>\n1. Dogs make everything better. Even Excel spreadsheets.\n\n2. Happier employees = more productive employees.\n\n3. Having a dog-friendly workplace creates a welcoming and warm energy, which can help with team building and recruiting. Allowing employees to bring their dogs to work also cuts the potential cost of dog walkers and daycare from their budgets, enabling them to save money five days a week.\n\n4. On a similar note, letting employees bring dogs to work removes the stress of tight time constraints — there’s less pressure to run home to feed or walk the dog at the end of the day. One 2008 survey of both small and big companies showed that dog-friendly offices had employees who were willing to work longer hours as well as lower rates of employee absenteeism. Employees working alongside their dogs are more inclined to stick around, finish work without feeling rushed, and go home when they’re ready.\n\n5. Like I said before, this is all backed by #science. <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/study-office-dogs-reduce-work-related-stress.html">A 2012 study</a> from Virginia Commonwealth University found that employees surrounded by dogs in the workplace were less stressed than those who left their pets at home. Randolph Barker, a leader on <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/17538351211215366">the VCU study</a> published in the International Journal of Workplace Health Management, described the outcome as a “low cost wellness benefit.” (I’m nailing economic theory right now.)\n\n6. In the same study, researchers found that employees with in-office dogs reported higher productivity. Both of these benefits might be attributed to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone that decreases stress in the human body. Oxytocin, also known as the “cuddle hormone,” is released when bonding socially, snuggling, or petting and interacting with animals.\n\n7. Dogs foster a more collaborative work environment. Who needs a water cooler when you can gather ‘round a dog? Meet your cute new co-worker over a petting sesh. Everyone bonds over belly rubs.\n\n8. Walking, feeding, or playing with a dog is a nice way to <a href="https://www.inc.com/jordan-smith/companies-find-stress-reducing-benefits-of-office-dogs.html">break up your work day</a>. We already know that sitting at a desk for nine hours isn’t great for your health. Taking a walk around the block (or even just to the treats jar at the front of the office) with your pup is an incentive to get moving in the middle of the day.\n\nHave a working dog who makes office life better?

Like I said before, this is all backed by #science. <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/study-office-dogs-reduce-work-related-stress.html">A 2012 study</a> from Virginia Commonwealth University found that employees surrounded by dogs in the workplace were less stressed than those who left their pets at home. Randolph Barker, a leader on <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/17538351211215366">the VCU study</a> published in the International Journal of Workplace Health Management, described the outcome as a “low cost wellness benefit.” (I’m nailing economic theory right now.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n6. In the same study, researchers found that employees with in-office dogs reported higher productivity. Both of these benefits might be attributed to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone that decreases stress in the human body. Oxytocin, also known as the “cuddle hormone,” is released when bonding socially, snuggling, or petting and interacting with animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n7. Dogs foster a more collaborative work environment. Who needs a water cooler when you can gather ‘round a dog? Meet your cute new co-worker over a petting sesh. Everyone bonds over belly rubs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n8. Walking, feeding, or playing with a dog is a nice way to <a href="https://www.inc.com/jordan-smith/companies-find-stress-reducing-benefits-of-office-dogs.html">break up your work day</a>. We already know that sitting at a desk for nine hours isn’t great for your health. Taking a walk around the block (or even just to the treats jar at the front of the office) with your pup is an incentive to get moving in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHave a working dog who makes office life better?

While adoption is one of the biggest ways to make an impact, it’s certainly not the only one. Here are a few creative ways you can get involved and make a real difference in the lives of rescue pets.\r\n<h5>Foster</h5>\r\nMany people can’t commit to a permanent adoption due to busy schedules, traveling, or expenses. Holding off on adopting is a responsible decision when you know you can’t care for an animal long-term, but if you have a two or four week opening on your calendar, fostering might be for you. Plenty of local rescues need foster homes for animals, and sometimes organizations will even pay for all the expenses as long as you can provide love and shelter. It might be hard to say goodbye at the end of the foster stay, but remember that you’ve helped free up space for that organization to take in even more animals.\r\n<h5>Volunteer</h5>\r\nWalk into any shelter and ask if they need help and you’ll be hard pressed to find one that will turn you down. It takes a village to run any nonprofit and when you have animals that need to be cared for, it’s that much more important to have volunteers. Whether you’re looking to help with marketing, fundraising, or simply want to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-importance-of-letting-your-dog-sniff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk dogs</a>, your skill set and time will be put to good use.\r\n<h5>Educate</h5>\r\nSo you’re allergic to anything with four legs but still want to help in the plight to save animals. Become an educator! Often times, rescues already have some sort of program in place to educate the community about helping their local pet population. You can go to schools, religious organizations, or businesses and host a discussion on spay/neuter, how to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dangerous-items-dogs-hiding-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">care for pets</a>, and why adoption is important. Education is one of the most powerful tools in the fight against homelessness for pets.\r\n<h5>Fundraise</h5>\r\nIf you like to host events or plan parties, consider organizing a fundraiser for your local shelter. It can be as simple as a bake sale or as extravagant as a gala; anything you can contribute will be an asset. Partner with a local boutique for a Shop Your Cause event, or ask your gym to host a workout fundraiser. Get creative with it and do something that you enjoy. In the end, your local shelter will appreciate whatever amount you raise.\r\n<h5>Donate</h5>\r\nIf you’re short on time and resources, skip that latte and donate $5 to a rescue of your choice instead. If you want to make a more direct impact, many organizations have a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/hurricane-harvey-how-to-help/">wish list</a> of items they need. You can usually find these lists under the donations tab on their website, or you can reach out to them directly and ask. Whether you can gift a blanket or a month’s supply of heart worm medication, your donation will help an animal in need.\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@butterandwilson</a></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Here’s How to Help Homeless Dogs Without Adopting', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '210-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:46:14', '2018-04-09 08:46:14', '', 210, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/210-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We know to monitor our sodium intake, avoid carrageenan and high fructose corn syrup, and understand that even organic, all-natural potato chips are still chips.\n\n\nPet food products, however, remain a mystery. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet food marketing</a> aims to paint a picture of health (think: images of farms and fresh vegetables on a shelf-stable bag of brown kibble), and every company promises to be the best option for your dog. It’s tempting to throw in the towel on label vigilance in the pet food aisle and blindly believe the bags, but understanding your dog’s food labels is just as important as carefully examining your own.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nStep one: learn to recognize the food label tricks that most pet companies are using.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>First ingredient</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\nJust because an ingredient is listed first on a label, doesn’t mean it’s the most potent in the product. Pet food companies know that most consumers are searching for a real meat source in that prized first ingredient slot. It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\n<h4>Natural</h4>\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds.

We know to monitor our sodium intake, avoid carrageenan and high fructose corn syrup, and understand that even organic, all-natural potato chips are still chips.\r\n\r\n\r\nPet food products, however, remain a mystery. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet food marketing</a> aims to paint a picture of health (think: images of farms and fresh vegetables on a shelf-stable bag of brown kibble), and every company promises to be the best option for your dog. It’s tempting to throw in the towel on label vigilance in the pet food aisle and blindly believe the bags, but understanding your dog’s food labels is just as important as carefully examining your own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStep one: learn to recognize the food label tricks that most pet companies are using.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>First ingredient</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust because an ingredient is listed first on a label, doesn’t mean it’s the most potent in the product. Pet food companies know that most consumers are searching for a real meat source in that prized first ingredient slot. It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Natural</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time.

Packed with dietary fiber and potassium, pumpkins are a superfood that can benefit your dog’s health (and waistline) all year.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA cup of plain pumpkin contains about 80 calories with a whopping 10 grams of dietary fiber – that’s about 1.25 grams of fiber per ounce. A serving this size also contains 1 gram of fat, 2 grams of protein, and just 5 mg of sodium.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dietary fiber and high moisture content can aid with digestion, relieve diarrhea, and prevent constipation\r\n2. Fiber acts as a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/does-your-dog-need-probiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probiotic</a>, supporting the growth and activity of helpful bacteria in your dog’s digestive tract\r\n3. Natural oils in both pumpkin and pumpkin seeds are rich in phytoestrogens, which can lower blood pressure and support heart health\r\n4. Pumpkin (like other <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">orange veggies</a>) is rich in beta-carotene and other antioxidants which may reduce your dog’s risk for cancer and can promote healthy vision\r\n5. Loaded with vitamin A for <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/how-to-keep-your-dogs-skin-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy skin</a>, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/wikipup-canine-dental-hygiene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teeth</a>, and bones\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How to Feed It:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPumpkin can be incorporated into your dog’s diet in a variety of ways. If your dog is suffering from diarrhea or constipation, try stirring a tablespoon or two of canned pumpkin into his normal food once a day to relieve symptoms. Feeling a little more culinary? Toast <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/superfoods-kitchen-pumpkin-seeds-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raw pumpkin seeds</a> at home with a drizzle of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/superfoods-kitchen-coconut-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coconut</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/olive-oil-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">olive</a> oil and serve them as a tasty treat, or grind them up and stir them into your dog’s food. You can also combine canned pumpkin with a cup of plain yogurt and freeze the mixture in ice cube trays for a refreshing, DIY treat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What to Watch For:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlways be sure to buy plain canned pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling. When it comes to your dog’s digestive system, added sugar and spice are anything but nice.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="http://www.food52.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Food52</a></em>', 'Superfoods in Your Kitchen: Pumpkins for Dogs', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '157-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:58:36', '2018-04-09 08:58:36', '', 157, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/157-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Used both as garnish and an ingredient, parsley comes in several different varieties. Flat-leaf parsley, also known as Italian parsley, has large, flat leaves and adds robust flavors in cooking (think soups, stews, and sauces) while curly parsley is primarily used for decoration. But it’s more than just a pretty face.\r\nThe Stats:\r\n\r\nPer tablespoon of chopped herb, parsley contains just 1 calorie and no fat or cholesterol. It contains less than 1 gram of carbohydrates, fiber, and protein but it is fairly rich in Vitamins A, C, and K as well as trace minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Parsley also boasts several volatile oils which have natural anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their antimicrobial and carminative benefits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to parsley for dogs, you should only feed the curly variety. Watch those serving sizes, as parsley does contain a toxic compound called furanocoumarin which can be dangerous in excessive amounts. In smaller servings, however, parsley does your dog more good than harm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Benefits:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Freshens bad breath thanks to microbial properties\r\n2. Rich in antioxidants that protect against free-radical damage\r\n3. Relieves swelling and pain from arthritis and other inflammatory conditions\r\n4. Vitamin K content improves blood clotting and boosts liver health\r\n5. Helps soothe upset stomach and digestive problems\r\n6. Diuretic properties help prevent urinary tract infections\r\n7. Immune system support via Vitamin C\r\n8. Helps flush toxins from the body, supporting kidney health\r\n9. Vitamin A content supports vision and eye health\r\n10. Can slow the rate of growth for tumors and certain cancers\r\nHow to Feed It:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWondering how to incorporate parsley into your dog’s diet? He may not chomp down on a fresh bunch right off the bat, but adding a little to his regular food a few times a week should do the trick. If you’re concerned about accidentally giving your dog too much parsley, play it safe by blending with water (1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight) and creating a juice you can pour right into your his water bowl. You can also brew parsley root into a tea (1 teaspoon per 10 pounds of bodyweight), or bake some into homemade dog treats.

A new twist on tea and cookies for the whole gang.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nImage: Food52', 'Superfoods in Your Kitchen: Parsley for Dogs', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '159-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:59:35', '2018-04-09 08:59:35', '', 159, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/159-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Packed with a powerful flavor punch, this elixir works well in homemade salad dressings, juices, and wellness shots and has big benefits for both humans and dogs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nApple cider vinegar, better known as ACV to health junkies, is made by extracting the juice from crushed apples and mixing it with beneficial bacteria and yeast. This starts the process of fermentation, through which natural sugars are converted to alcohol and, eventually, vinegar. High levels of natural enzymes and beneficial bacteria have made ACV a go-to natural remedy for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Acts as a digestive aid to regulate digestion and relieve digestive upset\r\n2. Works as a tonic for the <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/a-dog-a-uti-and-a-vulva-one-pups-uterine-saga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urinary tract system</a>  to prevent UTIs, bladder and kidney stones\r\n3. May help to alleviate or reduce <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/remedies-for-your-dogs-allergies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allergic reactions</a>\r\n4. Improves <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/winter-hack-prepping-paws-for-snow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cold weather</a> tolerance\r\n5. Naturally clears up bacterial and fungal infections, particularly in the skin\r\n6. Fights tooth decay and may <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/natural-remedies-for-dogs-with-bad-breath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve breath</a>\r\n7. Improves the growth and condition of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/how-to-keep-your-dogs-skin-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy skin and coat</a>\r\n8. Works as a natural antibiotic to protect against bacterial diseases\r\n9. Helps to reduce itchy skin, flakiness, and dander\r\n10. May help balance internal pH levels which can protect against disease\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How to Feed It:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to offer your dog apple cider vinegar is to add some to his water bowl. Use no more than one tablespoon per 50 pounds of bodyweight and limit your use to twice a week. If your dog doesn’t like the strong flavor, try reducing the amount to 1 teaspoon per 50 pounds of bodyweight, cooking it into a homemade dog treat, or stirring some into your dog’s <a href="http://www.thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh meals</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Other Uses:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog won’t ingest apple cider vinegar because of the taste, you can still use it as a natural ear cleaner or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/diy-guide-grooming-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIY</a> flea repellant rinse. To make an ear cleaning solution, mix equal parts water and apple cider vinegar, then dip a cotton ball in the solution and gently use it to clean your dog’s ears. For a DIY flea rinse, mix 1 cup distilled water with ½ cup each of apple cider vinegar and brewed green tea (cooled) and then apply it to your dog’s coat after bathing. Massage into his skin, rinse well, and pat dry. Flea-free and flawless. We salute you, ACV.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="http://goop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goop</a> </em>', 'Superfoods in Your Kitchen: Apple Cider Vinegar for Dogs', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '172-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:25:08', '2018-04-09 09:25:08', '', 172, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/172-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

A serving this size contains 5 grams of fat, 5 grams of protein, and 15 grams of carbohydrates. It also contains a whopping 5 grams of dietary fiber! Pumpkin seeds are incredibly rich in phosphorus and magnesium and contain a significant amount of copper, zinc, calcium, iron, and antioxidants as well.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\n1. Act as a natural de-wormer to get rid of tapeworms and other intestinal parasites\n2. May help dislodge kidney stones and prevent them from reforming\n3. Omega-3 fatty acid content helps to improve the <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/how-to-keep-your-dogs-skin-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">condition of skin</a> and coat\n4. Fiber content improves and regulates digestion to prevent constipation\n5. Antioxidants protect against free-radical damage and oxidation in cells\n6.

It’s been used in cooking for thousands of years and is primarily comprised of monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, and antioxidants. It contains about 120 calories per tablespoon and 14 grams of fat (the good kind!).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Monounsaturated fatty acids support fat breakdown in the cells, helping to shed stored fat\r\n2. Antioxidant content protects against free-radical damage and oxidation to increase lifespan\r\n3. Natural anti-inflammatory properties help reduce the risk for serious diseases like cancer, heart\r\ndisease, and diabetes\r\n4. Supports healthy brain function and helps to prevent cognitive decline, especially in older dogs\r\n5. Oleic acid content works with other beneficial compounds to protect against cancer\r\n6. Healthy monounsaturated fatty acids support heart health by reducing cholesterol\r\n7. Helps to increase blood flow for improved heart health and general health\r\n8. Reduces effects of asthma and supports respiratory health (particularly for brachycephalic breeds)\r\n9. Improves coat condition and moisturizes dry and flaky skin\r\n10. Makes food more palatable and attractive to dogs, especially for picky eaters\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How to Feed It:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to incorporate olive oil into your dog’s diet is to drizzle it over his food or use it as an ingredient in homemade dog treats. Just don’t serve your dog salad that’s been slathered in dressing. Servings should be limited to one teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight per day.\r\n<h4>What to Watch For:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBe careful with what kind of olive oil you choose and how much you feed your pup. Stick to extra virgin olive oil, since it has a lower acid content than other olive oils.

It’s had supporting roles in Thanksgiving stuffings and frequently stars alongside rosemary and thyme in various poultry recipes. But how much do you know about the benefits of sage for dogs?\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\nSage comes in different forms that have both medicinal and culinary applications. Garden sage (<i>Salvia officinalis</i>) is the most common variety, known for its soft, silvery green leaves. Pineapple sage (<i>Salvia elegans</i>) is highly attractive to hummingbirds and is used more for its medicinal benefits than for its flavor. Both golden sage and purple sage are grown ornamentally and for culinary application, while Berggarten sage produces particularly large, aromatic leaves. In addition to having a wonderful flavor and aroma, sage offers natural antiseptic, antibacterial, antimicrobial, and astringent properties.\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n1.  Contains Vitamins A, E, and K which support bone, skin, and eye health in addition to promoting healthy immunity\r\n2. Loaded with trace minerals like calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and zinc to support balanced nutrition\r\n3. The astringent properties of sage reduce redness and inflammation to heal skin infections\r\n4. Sage leaves can be used to ease gas or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/every-pet-owner-needs-know-bloat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bloating</a> and to treat gastrointestinal tract infections\r\n5. The leaves of the sage plant contain <em>rosmarinic acid</em> which may reduce the symptoms of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/remedies-for-your-dogs-allergies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seasonal allergies</a>\r\n6. Antioxidant properties which may help to protect against oxidation in the cells and reduce free-radical damage\r\n7. Antimicrobial properties naturally kill harmful pathogens that could cause infection\r\n8. Oils in the plant contain <em>ketones, </em>which can improve mental clarity and protect against cognitive decline\r\n9. Contains dietary fiber which may support healthy digestion and relieve constipation or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/causes-of-dog-diarrhea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diarrhea</a>\r\n10. Natural anti-inflammatory benefits may help relieve arthritis <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-signs-dog-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain</a> and other inflammatory conditions\r\n<h4>How to Feed It:</h4>\r\nThe easiest way to include sage in your dog’s diet is to mix fresh or dried leaves into his food. You can also boil dried sage leaves and Epsom salts in water to create a topical application to heal skin infections. As with many other superfood herbs, you can also bake sage into homemade dog treats.\r\n<h4>What to Watch For:</h4>\r\nUnlike some herbs which can cause digestive upset in large doses, sage is recognized by the ASPCA as being non-toxic for dogs. You should still limit your dog’s intake to a few leaves a day, but there’s no <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">danger of poisoning</a>.\r\n\r\nDo you have any helpful tips for growing sage?

Share the wealth with your pup.\r\n<h4><strong>The Stats:</strong></h4>\r\nPeppermint (<em>m</em><i>entha balsamea</i>) may soothe your dog’s nausea and upset stomach, but in large quantities it can also cause liver or kidney problems. Similarly, spearmint (<em>m</em><em>entha</em><i> spicata</i>) can freshen your dog’s breath and repel fleas, but larger doses could cause diarrhea or vomiting, so <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/skinny-dogs-live-longer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proper portioning</a> is key. The mint family is diverse, with varieties like lavender mint, apple mint, and even pineapple mint. Just be sure to steer clear of Pennyroyal (m<i>entha pulegium</i>), a type of non-culinary mint that is toxic for both people and pets.\r\n<h4><strong>Benefits:</strong></h4>\r\n1. Fresh mint is rich in Vitamins A and C which support healthy bones, skin, and vision as well as immunity\r\n2. It’s full of trace minerals like calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, folate, potassium, and zinc which all play a key role in balanced nutrition\r\n3. Mint leaves are a natural source of dietary fiber which can promote healthy digestion\r\n4. The antioxidant benefits of fresh mint protect against free-radical damage and oxidation in the cells\r\n5. Soothes upset stomach and relieves nausea or diarrhea\r\n6. Contains <em>rosmarinic acid</em> which has been shown to relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergies…\r\n7.  …and <em>menthol</em>, a natural decongestant which can help break up mucus and phlegm, relieving respiratory ailments\r\n8. Relieves symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease and reduces gas\r\n9. The leaves of the plant in particular may help reduce side effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatments\r\n10. Mint has natural antiviral, antimicrobial, antibacterial, and antifungal benefits which can all help <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/wikipup-canine-dental-hygiene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freshen your dog’s breath</a>\r\n<h4><strong>How to Feed It:</strong></h4>\r\nThe easiest way to add mint to your dog’s diet is to sprinkle a little fresh or dried mint over his food. Just don’t overdo it – a few leaves a day is about all your dog should be getting.\r\n<h4><strong>What to Watch For:</strong></h4>\r\nWhile fresh mint can be good for your dog’s health, artificial forms are another story. Breath mints, for example, often contain xylitol, an artificial sweetener that can be <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic for dogs</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you want to give your dog a mint-flavored treat, try your hand at <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/natural-remedies-for-dogs-with-bad-breath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homemade biscuits </a>with a few easy ingredients.

(279, 1, '2018-04-09 09:43:47', '2018-04-09 09:43:47', 'There’s a common misconception that if you aren’t ready to<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-rescue-runways-guide-to-adopting-a-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> adopt a dog</a>, you can’t help a homeless pet. While adoption is one of the biggest ways to make an impact, it’s certainly not the only one. Here are a few creative ways you can get involved and make a real difference in the lives of rescue pets.\r\n<h5>Foster</h5>\r\nMany people can’t commit to a permanent adoption due to busy schedules, traveling, or expenses. Holding off on adopting is a responsible decision when you know you can’t care for an animal long-term, but if you have a two or four week opening on your calendar, fostering might be for you. Plenty of local rescues need foster homes for animals, and sometimes organizations will even pay for all the expenses as long as you can provide love and shelter. It might be hard to say goodbye at the end of the foster stay, but remember that you’ve helped free up space for that organization to take in even more animals.\r\n<h5>Volunteer</h5>\r\nWalk into any shelter and ask if they need help and you’ll be hard pressed to find one that will turn you down. It takes a village to run any nonprofit and when you have animals that need to be cared for, it’s that much more important to have volunteers. Whether you’re looking to help with marketing, fundraising, or simply want to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-importance-of-letting-your-dog-sniff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk dogs</a>, your skill set and time will be put to good use.\r\n<h5>Educate</h5>\r\nSo you’re allergic to anything with four legs but still want to help in the plight to save animals. Become an educator! Often times, rescues already have some sort of program in place to educate the community about helping their local pet population. You can go to schools, religious organizations, or businesses and host a discussion on spay/neuter, how to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dangerous-items-dogs-hiding-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">care for pets</a>, and why adoption is important. Education is one of the most powerful tools in the fight against homelessness for pets.\r\n<h5>Fundraise</h5>\r\nIf you like to host events or plan parties, consider organizing a fundraiser for your local shelter. It can be as simple as a bake sale or as extravagant as a gala; anything you can contribute will be an asset. Partner with a local boutique for a Shop Your Cause event, or ask your gym to host a workout fundraiser. Get creative with it and do something that you enjoy. In the end, your local shelter will appreciate whatever amount you raise.\r\n<h5>Donate</h5>\r\nIf you’re short on time and resources, skip that latte and donate $5 to a rescue of your choice instead. If you want to make a more direct impact, many organizations have a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/hurricane-harvey-how-to-help/">wish list</a> of items they need. You can usually find these lists under the donations tab on their website, or you can reach out to them directly and ask. Whether you can gift a blanket or a month’s supply of heart worm medication, your donation will help an animal in need.\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@butterandwilson</a></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Here’s How to Help Homeless Dogs Without Adopting', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '210-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:43:47', '2018-04-09 09:43:47', '', 210, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/210-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It’s great for all dogs, but especially the ones with those special dietary needs like Kai. And after I’ve switched her food countless times, I was so excited to try something new that didn’t involve randomly picking a new “hypo-allergenic” dog food off a shelf at the pet store.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInstead, here’s how The Farmer’s Dog works: You fill out an <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/#signup-box">online questionnaire</a> about your dog’s size, weight, activity level, protein preference (turkey, beef, or pork) etc., then you’ll get back a customized food plan that’s delivered to you every two weeks in pre-portioned packets. You keep 5 at a time in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer (you might have to clear out some of your frozen pizza stash to make room, but you’ll survive). Then you simply feed your pup one of the packets from the fridge at breakfast and one at dinner and you’re done! There’s no measuring or hassle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKai could hardly contain herself when I received the first shipment of food and now that we’re 2 weeks into her new food regimen, there’s no way she’ll settle for kibble again.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are three awesome things that happened in the first two weeks of using The Farmer’s Dog:\r\n<h4><strong>1. My Dog’s Allergies Got SO Much Better</strong></h4>\r\nHow do I know when Kai’s allergies are bad? The easiest sign is that the hair on her head gets splotchy (see photos below). Within a week of eating The Farmer’s Dog food, the area looked significantly better. She wasn’t itchy at all and the sensitive skin on her belly returned to the normal pink color, instead of reddish and irritated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd TMI alert — her poop looked better than ever. Believe me, it’s easy to tell when you have a 95-pound dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Farmer’s Dog food is shipped to you within days of being made in human-grade kitchens in New York and you won’t believe the difference in how it looks and smells compared to the stuff you’ve been feeding your dog. At this point, Kai is probably eating better than I am…\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>2. She LOVES Eating</strong></h4>\r\nKai already loved to eat, but she was next-level excited for mealtime these last few weeks. Even if she was sound asleep on the couch before dinner, all I had to do was walk to the fridge, take out a packet, and start to pour it in her bowl and she would spring into action — with a giant string of drool hanging out of her mouth as she waited. She never reacted like that to her previous kibble dinner. No way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome nights she’d even eat all of her food then return a few minutes later to her bowl and lick it again — just to make sure she hadn’t missed a piece.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>3. I Felt Good About Feeding Her</strong></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter trying out The Farmer’s Dog, I realized I was a crazy and also <strong>lazy</strong> dog mom. After so many failed attempts at finding the right food for her allergy needs, I stuck with a kibble that was fine but not great. I didn’t really think there was anything better out there. She wasn’t itchy or in pain with her old food (I’m not <em>that</em> bad), but after seeing the improvement with The Farmer’s Dog, it was very apparent that there was something soo much better for her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, let’s be honest: her new food plan is more expensive than her kibble (cost per week varies according to the size and needs of your dog, but plans start at about $29 a week), but my dog and her health are 100% worth it. I’ll eat out one fewer time a month or ditch that afternoon Starbucks and quickly find the extra money to keep my furry BFF happy and, most importantly, healthy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images:  </em><a href="http://www.livingly.com/team/Deena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deena Bustillo </a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'My Dog Has Terrible Allergies and This Meal Service Changed All That', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '208-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:43:58', '2018-04-09 09:43:58', '', 208, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/208-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

When she isn’t collaborating with athleisure brands like Bandier or developing her own fashion line, Arielle soaks up quality time with her 1-year-old daughter, Ruby Lou. Instagram followers can’t get enough of the mother-daughter duo, and Arielle’s feed is full of candid videos of the pair sharing dance parties, watching their favorite movies, and eating home cooked meals together. We caught up with the powerhouse NYC mom about her dog, Dylan, and her favorite morning rituals with her family.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>When did you first become a dog mom? Tell us a little bit about Dylan and what makes your relationship special.</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI got Dylan 5 years ago with my boyfriend (now husband) as our first dog together. We had met another dog that we thought we wanted, but once we met Dylan we knew he was meant to be part of our family. Dylan is so special to us because he was my first “born.” He started our family, which has now grown into four along with his baby sister, Ruby.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How do you prioritize Dylan’s health in your daily routine? </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan’s health has always been very important to us and we always thought we were giving him the best. He wound up developing HGE and was in hospitals on and off, and we tried so many different brands of food. We thankfully found <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Farmer’s Dog</a> and that has been a game changer!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’re also mom to a beautiful baby girl named Ruby! How did you prepare Dylan for the transition of having a new baby in the house?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen we first had Ruby, we took her blanket from the hospital and put it in Dylan’s bed so he could get familiar with her scent. At first we were very cautious because we didn’t know how he would adjust to a new family member. Now Ruby can’t get enough of him and they are best friends! They love watching <em>The Secret Life of Pets</em> together. They do everything together.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your favorite part of being a mom?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s ALL amazing. I couldn’t be happier. But the best part is waking her up every morning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How has your view of health changed since having Ruby?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSince having Ruby, we are constantly cooking at home. We’re always trying new things to find out what Ruby likes, which has made us <em>all</em> more health conscious!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What does a typical healthy day look like for you, Dylan, and Ruby? Are there special activities that the three of you share?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan, Ruby, and I have a morning ritual! The three of us take a walk to get coffee, and if the weather is really nice we’ll walk into SoHo for breakfast.

This summer, <a href="http://www.dogumenta.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dOGUMENTA (I) NYC</a> is offering pet owners (and lovers) a new opportunity to connect and experience visual art with their dogs. We sat down with founding curator Jessica Dawson to talk about the inspiration behind the exhibit and the biggest lesson dogs can teach us about art.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What inspired the launch of dOGUMENTA?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe project was inspired by my gallery visits with my rescue dog Rocky, whose insights inspired the Dogumenta manifesto “<a href="http://www.dogumenta.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 Things My Dog Taught Me About Art</a>.” I delivered the manifesto at a gallery in Brooklyn last year and felt that it was time for canines to have an art show all their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How did you begin curating the exhibit? What kind of visual artists did you want to include?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce we found our venue partner (Brookfield Place in New York), we started hounding artists whose work we found interesting. All of the artists we’re featuring in the show responded immediately to the concept and understood how it operated on multiple levels at once. Mica Scalin (my creative development consultant and partner) and I vetted their capabilities, and then we brought Rocky with us to studio visits where he could sniff out their ideas in more detail.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRocky has a curious nature that has made him a great curating partner. He developed a rapport with the artists and together we had a dialog to determine which works would be most suitable for exhibition. The process has been really fun and illuminating for us and that’s what we hope to bring to the public in this exhibition.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What approach did the artists take to creating work for dogs?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAll of the artists are excited to frame ideas from their existing practice for a new audience and have been considering dogs’ unique points of view and perception. There will be work about the emotional issues dogs face — <a href="https://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>, which is common — as well as work that speaks to dogs’ interest in certain color schemes (they can see blue, yellow and grey). Works exploring formal, conceptual, and relational issues will be executed in a variety of media from sound and sculpture to kibble and squeaky toys.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBroadly, we know that canines perceive the world in unique ways. Olfaction is essential to their understanding, the color spectrum they see is different from a human’s, and of course they live closer to the ground. They’re also fearless and willing to engage with work in a variety of different ways, like sniffing, peeing, and licking. We expect a really diverse range of interactions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThat said, we hesitate to speak too broadly for an entire species. Just like humans, individual dogs have different attractions and aversions so we are intentionally presenting works that address a variety of aesthetic and conceptual concerns. Some artists are interested in specifics of a dog’s physical perspective or perceptual abilities, while others are more concerned with emotional connections.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe look forward to learning from the show. Will hounds react differently than terriers? Dachshunds vs Dobermans? Each piece of artwork addresses canine viewers differently, so the whole show is an experiment for both the curators and the artists.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you hope visitors will take away from the exhibit?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\ndOGUMENTA offers both the chance for humans to get to know their canine friends better and also the opportunity to approach art differently themselves. Attendees will gain new insights into their companion’s personality and character. It’s an opportunity for bonding and learning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is the biggest lesson dogs have taught you about art?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGo with your gut!

Unfortunately, my stint as a pre-vet student didn’t last very long after I fainted in my dissection class, so I’ve had to find other ways to help animals.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Chicago-based animal lover spent years volunteering at shelters, and found a new way to make her mark when she created <a href="https://www.therescuerunway.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rescue Runway</a> in February 2017. The popular blog marries her love of animals and fashion by chronicling trips to local shelters and including information on both her outfits and the pictured pups in need of homes. Whenever possible, she tries to wear clothing brands that support and donate proceeds to animal organizations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHer idea has resonated with dog lovers and fashion enthusiasts alike.

I follow many fashion bloggers and love when they share pictures of their pups, and one day I had a light bulb moment. I realized my passion for clothes could be combined with my love of equally adorable dogs (and cats!) in a new kind of fashion blog. A blog that not only shows off fun outfits, but also has a purpose behind it that people can connect with.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>You do a lot of work to raise awareness about homeless pets in Chicago. What has the response from your community been like? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo say it’s been amazing would be an understatement. Since day one, people have reached out from across the city and country telling me how wonderful of a platform this is for the rescue world. I’ve been lucky to meet some pretty incredible people in Chicago who are just as passionate about adoption as I am, and everyone has been so supportive and offered advice along the way.

Hattrick and Stanley are both working on their summer bodies and were in need of a leaner diet. Luckily, <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a> provided well-balanced meals to kick-start their weight loss goals. I’m happy to report that Stanley has lost five pounds and Hattrick is down three!

People don’t often realize that you can rescue almost any kind of dog. Big, little, purebred or mutt, the perfect pup is out there waiting for you. It may take a little research, but I promise it’s worth it.

A former Wilhelmina model and artist, Lauren was a founding team member at <a href="https://ritual.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ritual</a>, a health tech company that’s reinventing the vitamin through simplicity and traceability. Their first product, a multivitamin for women, contains just nine vitamins and minerals, compared with more than 20 typically found in other supplements.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLauren leads Marketing and Growth at Ritual and is based out of Los Angeles with her husband and two dogs, Rocky and Apollo. We chatted with Lauren about her favorite rituals, how she thinks about nutrition for her pups, and why New Year’s Eve holds a special significance in her house.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Tell us a little bit about your dogs, Rocky and Apollo.</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOur former dog was a 14 year old lab, Rocco, and when he passed away it just felt like there was a void in our house. We had seen this litter of English Retriever puppies and fell in love with two of them. Every day for three months I kept asking my fiancé (now husband) if we could get them. We were really debating it, though, because it’s such a huge responsibility. I’m pregnant, we were planning our wedding, we both work at startups…there’s always a lot going on!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFinally, I talked to my dad about it and he told me to follow my heart and get them. I was inspired by him, so on New Year’s Eve, instead of going to this party we had tickets to, we drove to Long Beach and picked up Rocky and Apollo. We’ve never been happier! Obviously, it was the right decision and we adore them. They’re really good puppies; they understand “no,” they haven’t torn a lot up in our house, and they’re housebroken. We’ve been really lucky in that regard.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How did you choose a pet food when you first got your pups? What was your main criteria in selecting a food? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy husband and I eat healthy and are conscious of the food we put in our bodies, and we try to do the same for our dogs. I had initially thought that certain dry food brands might be a good option compared to the more mainstream ones, because it seemed like they didn’t have a lot of gross stuff in there. After doing a little bit more research, though, I learned that it was mostly marketing and that a lot of dry food is pretty much the same.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen we discovered <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, and the dogs go so crazy for it. I’ve been uploading photos and videos to my Instagram of them eating the food because it’s the funniest thing. We have these slow feeder maze bowls for them they’re ravenous all the time, and they literally go in circles in the mazes trying to eat their Farmer’s Dog food super fast. There’s always one or two chickpeas that get caught in the maze and they end up flipping over their bowls to get to them! They just love the food.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Did you notice any changes in Rocky and Apollo when you switched them to a fresh food diet?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat people notice on our dogs is that their fur is super silky. It’s gorgeous and so thick and soft! I would say an improvement in fur is one big thing. They’re very happy and super healthy all around, and I’m sure the food has a lot to do with that.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How has switching to fresh food changed the way you think about their nutrition?</b><b> </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think people should just think about it the same way they think about feeding themselves. Would you eat Lucky Charms for every meal, every day? Probably not. Our dogs are living, breathing creatures and require real nutrients. The quality of the nutrients we get from fresh foods like vegetables and meat is so much higher than it would be in processed food.

(286, 1, '2018-04-09 09:45:54', '2018-04-09 09:45:54', 'Dr. Katy Nelson is somewhat of a legend in the pet world. An associate veterinarian at the Belle Haven Animal Medical Centre in Virginia and expert in animal health and nutrition, she is also the host and executive producer of <a href="http://www.thepetshow.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Pet Show with Dr. Katy</em></a>. Dr. Katy has been featured on the TODAY Show, Fox &amp; Friends, NPR, CNBC, The Meredith Vieira Show, and HuffPost Live, among others.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe sat down with Dr. Katy to talk about the importance of choosing the right diet for your dog, the advice she would give every aspiring vet, and why she’s dedicated her life to animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Tell us a little bit about your career path. When did you first know you wanted to be a veterinarian?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI grew up in South Louisiana and animals were always a huge part of my life. You name it, we had it — chickens, cows, even the occasional rabbit.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy dad’s best friend was a veterinarian when I was growing up, and one summer in college he told me about a job opening at a small local zoo. I was pre-med at the time, but I went and worked and a six week position turned into 13 weeks. I absolutely loved it and thought, “This is it. This is what I want to do.” I went back to school that fall and changed my major to a pre-vet track. Two years after that, I went to Louisiana State University’s School of Veterinary Medicine.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s one piece of advice you would give to someone who wants to become a vet?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think the biggest mistake people make when they go into veterinary medicine is thinking, “I don’t want to work with people; I just want to work with animals!” One of the biggest parts of our job is actually people relations. Like pediatricians, we have patients who can’t talk and can’t tell us where it hurts, and we have very concerned parents advocating for them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy biggest piece of advice for someone who wants to be a veterinarian is to take psychology, economics, and business classes. Having interpersonal communication skills and being business savvy is a big part of being a really good vet. Vets are highly intelligent people with big hearts, but most of them are also small business owners and there actually isn’t any business training in veterinary school.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce you make the decision that being a vet is what you want, dive in and study hard. It ain’t easy!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’re very vocal about the importance of nutrition for dogs. How big of an impact do you think food has on our dogs’ health and well-being?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs a mom, I’ve really delved hard into thinking about what I’m putting in my kids’ bodies. We all put so much time and interest into what we’re eating because we know it has an impact. We are what we eat, and the same thing goes for our pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf we’re feeding our pets protein that is so highly processed it’s lost all of its nutritional integrity, we’re not doing them any favors. It’s certainly cheaper in the moment, but it’s actually not cheaper in the long run when you consider that poor diet can cause diseases and health issues like diabetes down the line. If we start with good nutrition from day one, we have a heck of a better chance of our pets living long and healthy lives.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What advice do you give pet owners who are trying to choose the best food for their dog?</strong><b>\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA lot of pet health really has to do with choosing the right food for your dog. People think they’re feeding their dog really wonderful food because they’ve read a review online, or the 19-year-old restocking the shelves at the local pet store told them it was a great brand. What you really need to do is have a conversation with your vet. Your vet is going to be able to better assess your pet’s lifestyle and caloric needs and help you figure it all out.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat really impresses me so much about <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a> is that you guys are doing what I’ve been telling people to do for years. You’ve got the algorithms in place to account for lifestyle, disease, body condition, etc. and feed dogs accordingly. Pet owners need to figure out the right daily calorie count for their dogs and stick to it, remembering that treats are extra on top of that. I think one of the hardest things is for people to be honest about that. Sometimes it’s just easier not to think about it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What are some of the biggest health issues our pets are facing today? How can pet owners protect their dogs?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think the biggest epidemic we’re seeing in pets is definitely obesity. Almost 60% of American dogs are overweight or obese. That’s shocking!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe obesity issue stems from a lack of nutritional education and a lack of being able to recognize pet obesity by owners. In a study conducted by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention (APOP), pet owners were surveyed about their dogs’ weights. 100% of the dogs included in the study were considered obese, yet <em>90% of the owners</em> <em>polled</em> said their dogs were a normal weight!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPeople are completely in denial about what is and isn’t a healthy weight for their pets, but we have to start being realistic and treating pet obesity as seriously as we treat other health issues like thyroid conditions, heart disease and even cancer. We have the science to prove that pets who weigh less live longer, and we all want to give our dogs the longest, happiest lives possible. A massive part of that is nutrition. When we’re feeding our dogs good things, it translates to good health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy biggest piece of advice would be to talk with your vet and not take it personally if they tell you that your dog is overweight. Obesity is a diagnosis of a disease, not something to get offended over. They’re not saying <i>you’re</i> a bad pet owner, they’re saying your pet has a disease and it’s one you can treat and work on together as a team. If you look at it that way, you’ll have a lot more results than if you get defensive about what you’re feeding or how much exercise your dog is getting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Such important advice. Lastly, from one crazy dog lover to another, what do you think it is about dogs that makes them so special?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat I think is really cool is that in the last couple of years, even the Pope has spoken out about animals having souls. I think that’s something that we have known for years as dog owners. I know that when I look into my dog’s eyes there is a soul in there and a sentient being who loves me unconditionally, the way that I love him. It’s been validating that there have been so many books published over the last few years about how dogs touch our souls and communicate with us.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to connect with a dog, soul to soul. There are no pretenses and you don’t need makeup or your best clothes. Dogs aren’t going to judge you; they just love you. I think everyone’s goal is to find that unconditional love in life, and whether or not we find it in another human, we know our dogs love us unconditionally. Dogs give us the comfort and connection that everyone is seeking.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images: <a href="http://www.thepetshow.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katy Nelson</a></em>', 'Vets We Love: Meet Dr. Katy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '196-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:45:54', '2018-04-09 09:45:54', '', 196, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/196-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Kai, my 95-pound Dogo Argentino “lap dog” who thinks she’s the size of a chihuahua, has just about every allergy under the sun. No wheat or grains. Absolutely no chicken. Heck, it cost me $1,000 at the dog <em>dermatologist</em> to determine she’s also allergic to the sun. So, yeah, I’m a bit crazy, especially when we’re out and a well-intentioned, dog-loving person offers Kai a treat, which is bound to make her have diarrhea for a week — and/or give her a gnarly rash.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo, you can see why I jumped at the chance to try <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, a food delivery service for our four-legged friends that features <em>real</em> food (tested on humans!), created with board-certified veterinary nutritionists, and is customized to fit individual dog’s needs. It’s great for all dogs, but especially the ones with those special dietary needs like Kai. And after I’ve switched her food countless times, I was so excited to try something new that didn’t involve randomly picking a new “hypo-allergenic” dog food off a shelf at the pet store.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInstead, here’s how The Farmer’s Dog works: You fill out an <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/#signup-box">online questionnaire</a> about your dog’s size, weight, activity level, protein preference (turkey, beef, or pork) etc., then you’ll get back a customized food plan that’s delivered to you every two weeks in pre-portioned packets. You keep 5 at a time in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer (you might have to clear out some of your frozen pizza stash to make room, but you’ll survive). Then you simply feed your pup one of the packets from the fridge at breakfast and one at dinner and you’re done! There’s no measuring or hassle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKai could hardly contain herself when I received the first shipment of food and now that we’re 2 weeks into her new food regimen, there’s no way she’ll settle for kibble again.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are three awesome things that happened in the first two weeks of using The Farmer’s Dog:\r\n<h4><strong>1. My Dog’s Allergies Got SO Much Better</strong></h4>\r\nHow do I know when Kai’s allergies are bad? The easiest sign is that the hair on her head gets splotchy (see photos below). Within a week of eating The Farmer’s Dog food, the area looked significantly better. She wasn’t itchy at all and the sensitive skin on her belly returned to the normal pink color, instead of reddish and irritated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd TMI alert — her poop looked better than ever. Believe me, it’s easy to tell when you have a 95-pound dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Farmer’s Dog food is shipped to you within days of being made in human-grade kitchens in New York and you won’t believe the difference in how it looks and smells compared to the stuff you’ve been feeding your dog. At this point, Kai is probably eating better than I am…\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>2. She LOVES Eating</strong></h4>\r\nKai already loved to eat, but she was next-level excited for mealtime these last few weeks. Even if she was sound asleep on the couch before dinner, all I had to do was walk to the fridge, take out a packet, and start to pour it in her bowl and she would spring into action — with a giant string of drool hanging out of her mouth as she waited. She never reacted like that to her previous kibble dinner. No way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome nights she’d even eat all of her food then return a few minutes later to her bowl and lick it again — just to make sure she hadn’t missed a piece.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>3. I Felt Good About Feeding Her</strong></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter trying out The Farmer’s Dog, I realized I was a crazy and also <strong>lazy</strong> dog mom. After so many failed attempts at finding the right food for her allergy needs, I stuck with a kibble that was fine but not great. I didn’t really think there was anything better out there. She wasn’t itchy or in pain with her old food (I’m not <em>that</em> bad), but after seeing the improvement with The Farmer’s Dog, it was very apparent that there was something soo much better for her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, let’s be honest: her new food plan is more expensive than her kibble (cost per week varies according to the size and needs of your dog, but plans start at about $29 a week), but my dog and her health are 100% worth it. I’ll eat out one fewer time a month or ditch that afternoon Starbucks and quickly find the extra money to keep my furry BFF happy and, most importantly, healthy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images:  </em><a href="http://www.livingly.com/team/Deena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deena Bustillo </a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'My Dog Has Terrible Allergies and This Meal Service Changed All That', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '194-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:46:25', '2018-04-09 09:46:25', '', 194, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/194-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Used both as garnish and an ingredient, parsley comes in several different varieties. Flat-leaf parsley, also known as Italian parsley, has large, flat leaves and adds robust flavors in cooking (think soups, stews, and sauces) while curly parsley is primarily used for decoration. But it’s more than just a pretty face.\r\nThe Stats:\r\n\r\nPer tablespoon of chopped herb, parsley contains just 1 calorie and no fat or cholesterol. It contains less than 1 gram of carbohydrates, fiber, and protein but it is fairly rich in Vitamins A, C, and K as well as trace minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Parsley also boasts several volatile oils which have natural anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their antimicrobial and carminative benefits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to parsley for dogs, you should only feed the curly variety. Watch those serving sizes, as parsley does contain a toxic compound called furanocoumarin which can be dangerous in excessive amounts. In smaller servings, however, parsley does your dog more good than harm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Benefits:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Freshens bad breath thanks to microbial properties\r\n2. Rich in antioxidants that protect against free-radical damage\r\n3. Relieves swelling and pain from arthritis and other inflammatory conditions\r\n4. Vitamin K content improves blood clotting and boosts liver health\r\n5. Helps soothe upset stomach and digestive problems\r\n6. Diuretic properties help prevent urinary tract infections\r\n7. Immune system support via Vitamin C\r\n8. Helps flush toxins from the body, supporting kidney health\r\n9. Vitamin A content supports vision and eye health\r\n10. Can slow the rate of growth for tumors and certain cancers\r\nHow to Feed It:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWondering how to incorporate parsley into your dog’s diet? He may not chomp down on a fresh bunch right off the bat, but adding a little to his regular food a few times a week should do the trick. If you’re concerned about accidentally giving your dog too much parsley, play it safe by blending with water (1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight) and creating a juice you can pour right into your his water bowl. You can also brew parsley root into a tea (1 teaspoon per 10 pounds of bodyweight), or bake some into homemade dog treats.

A serving this size also contains 1 gram of fat, 2 grams of protein, and just 5 mg of sodium.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1.

We know to monitor our sodium intake, avoid carrageenan and high fructose corn syrup, and understand that even organic, all-natural potato chips are still chips.\r\n\r\nPet food products, however, remain a mystery. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet food marketing</a> aims to paint a picture of health (think: images of farms and fresh vegetables on a shelf-stable bag of brown kibble), and every company promises to be the best option for your dog. It’s tempting to throw in the towel on label vigilance in the pet food aisle and blindly believe the bags, but understanding your dog’s food labels is just as important as carefully examining your own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStep one: learn to recognize the food label tricks that most pet companies are using.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>First ingredient</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust because an ingredient is listed first on a label, doesn’t mean it’s the most potent in the product. Pet food companies know that most consumers are searching for a real meat source in that prized first ingredient slot. It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Natural</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible.

It’s a good time to review the most <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/">dangerous foods for your dog</a> (toxic ingredients like onion and garlic are often hidden in dishes like soups and stews), but contrary to popular belief, not all table food is bad for our dogs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo where does this myth come from?<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/"> Marketing, for starters</a>. After the invention of processed dog food, manufacturers were still struggling to successfully convince pet owners to replace real food with new, commercial varieties. So in the mid 1960s, the pet food industry launched a marketing campaign imploring consumers to “Ban All Table Scraps” from their pets’ bowls and switch to dry kibble. It worked, and we’ve been scared to give our dogs human food ever since. While the kibble guys were right in that you don’t want to train your dog to beg at the table or feed those garlic potatoes you just fried up, most people are starting to understand that a fresh food diet is a much healthier option for dogs. What some pet owners may not know is that even feeding the right table scraps can also be healthful and beneficial.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><b>How</b><b> do I know what “real” foods I can feed my dog?</b></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAvoid anything fried or cooked with additives and stick with <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/">whole, fresh foods</a> like meat, vegetables, and fruit. These are best in their natural states or lightly cooked, and are not only safe for your dogs, but also beneficial for their health. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/">Fresh food is also easier for your pup to digest</a> than processed dog food and can lead to better breath, a shinier coat, and a trimmer waistline. How many brown balls of kibble can promise that?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRemember, a few pieces of fresh turkey or broccoli in your dog’s bowl can be an amazing snack, but doesn’t count as a regular, balanced meal. If you want to experience the benefits of switching your dog over to an all-fresh diet, make sure you’re feeding<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/"> nutritionally balanced recipes</a> that have been formulated by a veterinary nutritionist.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><b>Any specific table scraps I should avoid?</b></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhile certain table foods are safe to share with your dog, you should keep the pizza and French Fries for your own cheat days. Everyone knows about chocolate, but here’s a quick recap of the table scraps that still deserve their bad rep.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Fried foods or dishes with added salt and spices\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Most Americans cook with copious amounts of butter and oil, making many holiday dishes a potential nutritional land mine for dogs (and humans)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Garlic and onion (they contain <i>allium</i>, which can damage your dog’s red blood cells and even cause them to burst)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Grapes and raisins (the exact toxin in this fruit family hasn’t been pinpointed, but grapes are high on the No Fly List for your dog’s bowl)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Packaged foods (artificial sweeteners like <em>x</em><em>ylitol</em> can sneak into packaged desserts, candies, and condiments and are some of the most dangerous ingredients for dogs)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Peaches and avocados (peach pits are poisonous, to say nothing of their danger as a choking hazard, while avocados contain a toxin called <i>persin</i>)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Tomato plants (a ripe tomato is fine, but a green tomato or any part of the plant itself can be toxic)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Cooked bones (chicken bones, we’re looking at you)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Raw potatoes (cooked is safe, but skip the buttery mashed variety)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhile your pup would no doubt love a plate of macaroni and cheese this holiday, rich foods can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and even pancreatitis if consumed in high quantities. The good news is that your dog will be just as happy enjoying a plate of steamed Brussels sprouts dressed in Turkey broth. So go ahead, put some leftover superfoods in that bowl and let the dogs join in on the holiday fun this year.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ps.ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ps.ny</a></em>', 'The Truth About Table Scraps for Dogs', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '174-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:48:22', '2018-04-09 09:48:22', '', 174, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/174-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Probiotics are good microbes (either bacteria or yeasts) that live in the digestive tract and help fight off the growth and activity of bad bacteria like E. coli and salmonella. In humans, they can boost our immune systems and improve gastrointestinal issues like diarrhea, IBS, and intestinal inflammations. While there are fewer studies on the effects of probiotics on dogs, there are a few known strains that can help your pup with digestion and upset stomach.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog is experiencing stomach troubles, your vet might suggest one of two alternatives: prebiotics work with the good bacteria already living in your dog’s colon to nourish it and promote growth, while probiotics nourish and combat any bad bacteria that might have infected your dog. Consult with your vet on the best option for your pup.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMany pet owners supplement their dogs’ diets with probiotics when they are experiencing gastrointestinal issues, many of which are caused by a highly processed diet of dry kibble. <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fresh, lightly cooked food</a>, on the other hand, is notoriously easier to digest than <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commercial pet foods</a>, and most dogs on a fresh diet do not require any additional probiotic supplements.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStill, adding probiotics to your dog’s diet isn’t any more harmful than your midday kombucha habit. Probiotics for dogs come in various forms, from powders to chews and capsules. Mixing yogurt or kefir with live cultures into your dog’s food is also an easy option, assuming you don’t mind sharing your breakfast.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHave probiotics helped your pup?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/milletandlara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@milletandlara</a></em>', 'Does Your Dog Need Probiotics, Too?', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '161-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:49:54', '2018-04-09 09:49:54', '', 161, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/161-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Used both as garnish and an ingredient, parsley comes in several different varieties. Flat-leaf parsley, also known as Italian parsley, has large, flat leaves and adds robust flavors in cooking (think soups, stews, and sauces) while curly parsley is primarily used for decoration. But it’s more than just a pretty face.\r\nThe Stats:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPer tablespoon of chopped herb, parsley contains just 1 calorie and no fat or cholesterol. It contains less than 1 gram of carbohydrates, fiber, and protein but it is fairly rich in Vitamins A, C, and K as well as trace minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Parsley also boasts several volatile oils which have natural anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their antimicrobial and carminative benefits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to parsley for dogs, you should only feed the curly variety. Watch those serving sizes, as parsley does contain a toxic compound called furanocoumarin which can be dangerous in excessive amounts. In smaller servings, however, parsley does your dog more good than harm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Benefits:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Freshens bad breath thanks to microbial properties\r\n2. Rich in antioxidants that protect against free-radical damage\r\n3. Relieves swelling and pain from arthritis and other inflammatory conditions\r\n4. Vitamin K content improves blood clotting and boosts liver health\r\n5. Helps soothe upset stomach and digestive problems\r\n6. Diuretic properties help prevent urinary tract infections\r\n7. Immune system support via Vitamin C\r\n8. Helps flush toxins from the body, supporting kidney health\r\n9. Vitamin A content supports vision and eye health\r\n10. Can slow the rate of growth for tumors and certain cancers\r\nHow to Feed It:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWondering how to incorporate parsley into your dog’s diet? He may not chomp down on a fresh bunch right off the bat, but adding a little to his regular food a few times a week should do the trick. If you’re concerned about accidentally giving your dog too much parsley, play it safe by blending with water (1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight) and creating a juice you can pour right into your his water bowl. You can also brew parsley root into a tea (1 teaspoon per 10 pounds of bodyweight), or bake some into homemade dog treats.

(301, 1, '2018-04-09 09:50:32', '2018-04-09 09:50:32', 'Health-conscious consumers are skilled at deciphering nutrition facts labels. We know to monitor our sodium intake, avoid carrageenan and high fructose corn syrup, and understand that even organic, all-natural potato chips are still chips.\r\n\r\nPet food products, however, remain a mystery. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet food marketing</a> aims to paint a picture of health (think: images of farms and fresh vegetables on a shelf-stable bag of brown kibble), and every company promises to be the best option for your dog. It’s tempting to throw in the towel on label vigilance in the pet food aisle and blindly believe the bags, but understanding your dog’s food labels is just as important as carefully examining your own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStep one: learn to recognize the food label tricks that most pet companies are using.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>First ingredient</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust because an ingredient is listed first on a label, doesn’t mean it’s the most potent in the product. Pet food companies know that most consumers are searching for a real meat source in that prized first ingredient slot. It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Natural</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible. Stick to foods you can see and the whole feeding process becomes a lot less tricky.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenikrauze/">@jenikrauze</a></em>', 'The 11 Dog Food Label Tricks Every Owner Needs to Know', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '145-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:50:32', '2018-04-09 09:50:32', '', 145, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/145-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(304, 1, '2018-04-09 09:54:28', '2018-04-09 09:54:28', 'We all want our dogs to look, feel, and smell their best, but it takes effort to keep that coat shiny. Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\r\nWhy do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?\r\n\r\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\r\n\r\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\r\n\r\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\r\n\r\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. teeth, nails, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\r\nGrooming by coat type\r\n\r\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\r\n\r\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog? Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\r\n\r\nSome dogs also have an undercoat, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\r\nHow does your dog’s diet affect coat health?\r\n\r\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair.

Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\n<h5><strong>Why do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?</strong></h5>\n&nbsp;\n\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. teeth, nails, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Grooming by coat type</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog? Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome dogs also have an undercoat, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\n\n<strong>How does your dog’s diet affect coat health?</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair.

There are times, however, when something goes awry and your dog’s digestive system stops working as smoothly as it should.\r\n\r\nConstipation is a condition characterized by difficult, infrequent, or completely absent bowel movements. Dogs are normally very regular, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/decoding-your-dogs-poop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">producing stools</a> once or twice a day, but they are just as prone to digestive difficulties as humans. Here is what you need to know about constipation in your<em> </em>dog.\r\n<h4>What Causes Constipation in Dogs?</h4>\r\nConstipation is one of the most common digestive problems seen in dogs and is typically easy to diagnose. Some of the most common symptoms of constipation include:\r\n\r\n1. Forceful but ineffective attempts to defecate\r\n2. Small, hard, or dry stools Redness or swelling around the anus\r\n3. Discharge from the anus after defecating\r\n4. Loss of appetite and/or weight loss\r\n5. Lethargy or depression\r\n6. Pain when defecating\r\n7. Scooting the bottom on the floor\r\n\r\nIf your dog hasn’t had a bowel movement in more than a day or two, it is a sure sign of constipation. But what exactly leads to constipation?\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of causes ranging from inadequate fiber content in your dog’s diet to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/save-your-dog-from-summertime-sadness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>. Constipation can also be caused by an enlarged prostate gland, excessive self-grooming, injury or trauma to the pelvis, and various neurological disorders. It can also be a side effect of certain medications or the result of an intestinal blockage.\r\n<h4>What Can You Do About It?</h4>\r\nMild cases of constipation in dogs typically resolve themselves with time, but more severe cases may require intervention. If your dog has only been constipated for a day or two, something as simple as stirring a little canned pumpkin (the human-grade variety is perfect!) into his food can provide a boost of fiber that might get things moving again. Increasing your dog’s <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water intake </a>or switching to <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fresh food diet </a>with natural moisture can help as well.\r\n\r\nIf neither of these relieve your dog’s constipation, you may want to talk to your veterinarian about a stool softener, laxative, or other medication to help get your dog’s digestion back on track. In some cases, an enema might become necessary to evacuate the bowel, but this is definitely not something you should try at home.\r\n<h4>How Do You Prevent Constipation?</h4>\r\nOlder dogs are more likely to develop constipation because their bowel activity naturally decreases with age. If your dog doesn’t drink a lot of water, he is also at risk for developing constipation. So, how do you prevent your dog from becoming constipated?\r\n\r\nThe best thing you can do is feed your pup a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy, high-quality diet</a> that includes fresh, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real food</a>. Make sure your dog’s diet has plenty of protein and healthy fats as well as digestible carbohydrates for dietary fiber. You may also want to consider supplementing with <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/does-your-dog-need-probiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probiotics</a> to help ensure healthy and regular digestion.\r\n\r\nThough constipation is usually a short-lived problem that resolves itself with time, chronic or prolonged constipation is not something you should ignore. If your dog exhibits severe signs of digestive distress or discomfort, take that tummy to the vet.\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/trinity.approved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@trinity.approved</a></em>', 'What you should know about your dog’s constipation', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '88-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 10:11:16', '2018-04-09 10:11:16', '', 88, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/88-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\r\n<h5><strong>Why do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. teeth, nails, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>Grooming by coat type</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog? Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome dogs also have an undercoat, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How does your dog’s diet affect coat health?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair. The important ones here are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (both of which you can find in superfoods like olive oil!). Omega-3s help to reduce general inflammation, which can cut down on dander and combat any bites or allergies, while omega-6s stimulate hair growth. A healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids ultimately results in a strong and lustrous coat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you think your dog might have an omega-3 or omega-6 deficiency, you can supplement his diet with fish or flaxseed oil or switch to a fresh, balanced meal plan. If you’re home cooking for your dog or supplementing yourself, check in with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure that you’re feeding a balanced diet. Brushing, bathing, and feeding your dog right?

Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair. The important ones here are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (both of which you can find in superfoods like olive oil!). Omega-3s help to reduce general inflammation, which can cut down on dander and combat any bites or allergies, while omega-6s stimulate hair growth. A healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids ultimately results in a strong and lustrous coat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you think your dog might have an omega-3 or omega-6 deficiency, you can supplement his diet with fish or flaxseed oil or switch to a fresh, balanced meal plan. If you’re home cooking for your dog or supplementing yourself, check in with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure that you’re feeding a balanced diet. Brushing, bathing, and feeding your dog right? Get ready for hair so healthy, it shines.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nImage: @thedogphotobooth', 'How to keep your dog\'s skin and coat healthy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '38-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 10:16:26', '2018-04-09 10:16:26', '', 38, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/38-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In addition to the emotional distress that Halloween can cause, that bowl of candy by the front door is also treacherous for any pet. Keep your dog away from these tricks in the treat bucket this Halloween.\r\n<h5>Chocolate</h5>\r\nWhether or not you have kids, chocolate is bound to make its way into your house this Halloween. Most dog owners are already aware of the dangers of chocolate for dogs, but here’s a quick refresher. The villain is a molecule found in chocolate known as <em>theobromine,</em> which is very difficult for dogs to digest. Not all chocolate is equally poisonous; dark chocolate contains more than six times the amount of the deadly molecule than milk chocolate, which means those Kit Kat Halloween Darkness candies are especially spooky. Smaller dogs are at a greater risk of getting sick than bigger breeds, and symptoms include vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, and increased heart rate. If ingested in large quantities, this sinister treat can lead to death, so keep that candy bowl far out of reach.\r\n<h5>Garlic</h5>\r\nGarlic is a key weapon in the fight against vampires, but it can also have adverse effects on your dog’s health. Garlic contains thiosulfate which damages red blood cells and can cause anemia. This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n<h5>Raisins</h5>\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n<h5>Candy</h5>\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach. Instead of chocolate or candy, chop up some <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh treats</a> for your dog to enjoy, like apples or carrots.

Not all chocolate is equally poisonous; dark chocolate contains more than six times the amount of the deadly molecule than milk chocolate, which means those Kit Kat Halloween Darkness candies are especially spooky. Smaller dogs are at a greater risk of getting sick than bigger breeds, and symptoms include vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, and increased heart rate. If ingested in large quantities, this sinister treat can lead to death, so keep that candy bowl far out of reach.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Garlic</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGarlic is a key weapon in the fight against vampires, but it can also have adverse effects on your dog’s health. Garlic contains thiosulfate which damages red blood cells and can cause anemia. This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Raisins</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Candy</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach. Instead of chocolate or candy, chop up some <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh treats</a> for your dog to enjoy, like apples or carrots. They may not be as decadent as your treats, but your dog’s health is a far better investment.

Here is a closer look at what therapy dogs do, the science behind their efficacy, and the steps you can take to get <em>your</em> pup certified.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>What is a therapy dog?</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\nFor starters, a therapy dog is not the same thing as a service dog (it’s also not a dog with a prescription pad and PhD). A service dog is trained to provide assistance to someone with a specific disability such as blindness, epilepsy, or PTSD. This is essentially a full-time job for that dog, as his owner is usually the person for whom he provides this particular service.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA therapy dog needs training as well, but it tends to be more generalized and temperament-centric than, say, the very specific way a service dog is trained to protect his owner’s head during a seizure. Therapy dogs visit hospitals, assisted living facilities, college campuses, and even prisons, and provide love, comfort, and companionship.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou know when you’ve had a bad day at work so you walk by the pet store on your way home and spend 30 minutes watching puppies playing in the window? It’s a lot like that, on a more institutional level.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>What is the science behind therapy dogs?</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\nIn addition to their winning combination of loyalty and fluffiness, dogs have been scientifically shown to make <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/5-ways-your-dog-is-making-you-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans healthier.</a> Therapy dogs in particular are proven to:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Reduce blood pressure\n</strong>High blood pressure (or hypertension) is a major risk for heart disease and stroke, so reduced blood pressure is tremendously important. Patients in assisted living facilities or hospitals may see lower blood pressure levels after spending extended periods of time petting a dog.\n\n<strong>Increase both endorphins and oxytocin\n</strong>Endorphins are essentially a naturally occurring form of morphine, inducing a little jolt of euphoria when activated (think: the high you feel after going on a long run). Oxytocin is also a very powerful hormone – often called “the love hormone” – and gets triggered when you hug or kiss a loved one (or see a friendly tail wagging your way). It’s also believed to be the chemical backbone that underlies the feeling of trust.\n\n<strong>Lower cortisol levels\n</strong>Cortisol is a steroid hormone released in response to stress, and it mostly works to increase blood sugar and assist in the metabolism of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Things like massage therapy and laughter <em>lower</em> cortisol levels, while caffeine, sleep deprivation, and severe trauma <em>increase</em> them. Which category would you rather fall into?\n\nOf course, not <em>every</em> dog has the temperament to be a therapy dog. My own dog, for example, has such an <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense fear of strangers</a> that most interactions lead to skyrocketing blood pressures for all parties involved. This, among other reasons, is why he won’t be signing up for therapy duty anytime soon.

Is your dog naturally calm and friendly around strangers? Do crowds, loud noises, and sudden movements give him anxiety? Has he received (and excelled in) at least basic obedience training?\n\nIf the answer to all of the above is yes, then congratulations! You’re on your way to becoming a dynamic therapy duo (you, as the handler, are an important part of this equation too). To become a licensed therapy dog, you and your pup will need to pass a test and get certified by an official registry. Though the specifics of the test will vary between registries, most tests gauge your dog’s ability to sit, stay, walk through a crowd, and respond to other commands.\n\nOnce you’re registered and ready to go, you can ask your registry for a list or simply reach out to hospitals, nursing homes, or any other group you feel could benefit from quality time with your newly anointed therapy dog. The world is your oyster; some therapy dogs even visit children’s libraries and sit with kids who are learning to read. Your dog’s patient, nonjudgmental gaze can help a child develop the confidence he or she will need to continue improving those reading skills.\n\nYou might not be able to heal the world, but your dog’s love and companionship can help brighten it.

The world is your oyster; some therapy dogs even visit children’s libraries and sit with kids who are learning to read. Your dog’s patient, nonjudgmental gaze can help a child develop the confidence he or she will need to continue improving those reading skills.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou might not be able to heal the world, but your dog’s love and companionship can help brighten it.

A service dog is trained to provide assistance to someone with a specific disability such as blindness, epilepsy, or PTSD. This is essentially a full-time job for that dog, as his owner is usually the person for whom he provides this particular service.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA therapy dog needs training as well, but it tends to be more generalized and temperament-centric than, say, the very specific way a service dog is trained to protect his owner’s head during a seizure. Therapy dogs visit hospitals, assisted living facilities, college campuses, and even prisons, and provide love, comfort, and companionship.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou know when you’ve had a bad day at work so you walk by the pet store on your way home and spend 30 minutes watching puppies playing in the window? It’s a lot like that, on a more institutional level.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What is the science behind therapy dogs?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn addition to their winning combination of loyalty and fluffiness, dogs have been scientifically shown to make <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/5-ways-your-dog-is-making-you-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans healthier.</a> Therapy dogs in particular are proven to:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Reduce blood pressure\r\n</strong>High blood pressure (or hypertension) is a major risk for heart disease and stroke, so reduced blood pressure is tremendously important. Patients in assisted living facilities or hospitals may see lower blood pressure levels after spending extended periods of time petting a dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Increase both endorphins and oxytocin\r\n</strong>Endorphins are essentially a naturally occurring form of morphine, inducing a little jolt of euphoria when activated (think: the high you feel after going on a long run). Oxytocin is also a very powerful hormone – often called “the love hormone” – and gets triggered when you hug or kiss a loved one (or see a friendly tail wagging your way). It’s also believed to be the chemical backbone that underlies the feeling of trust.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lower cortisol levels\r\n</strong>Cortisol is a steroid hormone released in response to stress, and it mostly works to increase blood sugar and assist in the metabolism of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Things like massage therapy and laughter <em>lower</em> cortisol levels, while caffeine, sleep deprivation, and severe trauma <em>increase</em> them. Which category would you rather fall into?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOf course, not <em>every</em> dog has the temperament to be a therapy dog. My own dog, for example, has such an <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense fear of strangers</a> that most interactions lead to skyrocketing blood pressures for all parties involved. This, among other reasons, is why he won’t be signing up for therapy duty anytime soon. Think your dog has what it takes?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How can my pup become a therapy dog?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you’re thinking about turning your dog into a charitable super hero, he’ll need to exhibit a few prerequisites. Is your dog naturally calm and friendly around strangers? Do crowds, loud noises, and sudden movements give him anxiety? Has he received (and excelled in) at least basic obedience training?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf the answer to all of the above is yes, then congratulations!

(333, 1, '2018-04-09 11:49:45', '2018-04-09 11:49:45', 'Once upon a time, having dogs in the office seemed like something out of a tech startup fairy tale; a beaming Yellow Labrador Retriever running up to a handsome CEO in a loft filled with busy engineers, the Golden Gate Bridge glistening through a window.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut these days, more and more companies across a wide range of industries and cities are adopting dog-friendly offices. Obviously, being surrounded by puppies all day would make anyone happy, but research shows that having dogs in the workplace can <em>actually</em> benefit your health, your boss, and your “profit margin.” (Is that what they call it? I majored in English.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDon’t believe me? Over the next few months we’ll be interviewing people from a variety of cities and industries about how bringing their working dogs to the office has impacted their lives, careers, and mental health. But first, a word from science.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Benefits of dogs in the workplace:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dogs make everything better. Even Excel spreadsheets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2. Happier employees = more productive employees.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3. Having a dog-friendly workplace creates a welcoming and warm energy, which can help with team building and recruiting. Allowing employees to bring their dogs to work also cuts the potential cost of dog walkers and daycare from their budgets, enabling them to save money five days a week.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n4. On a similar note, letting employees bring dogs to work removes the stress of tight time constraints — there’s less pressure to run home to feed or walk the dog at the end of the day. One 2008 survey of both small and big companies showed that dog-friendly offices had employees who were willing to work longer hours as well as lower rates of employee absenteeism. Employees working alongside their dogs are more inclined to stick around, finish work without feeling rushed, and go home when they’re ready.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n5. Like I said before, this is all backed by #science. <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/study-office-dogs-reduce-work-related-stress.html">A 2012 study</a> from Virginia Commonwealth University found that employees surrounded by dogs in the workplace were less stressed than those who left their pets at home. Randolph Barker, a leader on <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/17538351211215366">the VCU study</a> published in the International Journal of Workplace Health Management, described the outcome as a “low cost wellness benefit.” (I’m nailing economic theory right now.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n6. In the same study, researchers found that employees with in-office dogs reported higher productivity. Both of these benefits might be attributed to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone that decreases stress in the human body. Oxytocin, also known as the “cuddle hormone,” is released when bonding socially, snuggling, or petting and interacting with animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n7. Dogs foster a more collaborative work environment. Who needs a water cooler when you can gather ‘round a dog? Meet your cute new co-worker over a petting sesh. Everyone bonds over belly rubs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n8. Walking, feeding, or playing with a dog is a nice way to <a href="https://www.inc.com/jordan-smith/companies-find-stress-reducing-benefits-of-office-dogs.html">break up your work day</a>. We already know that sitting at a desk for nine hours isn’t great for your health. Taking a walk around the block (or even just to the treats jar at the front of the office) with your pup is an incentive to get moving in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHave a working dog who makes office life better?

Research shows that dogs exhibit recognition for both their littermates and biological mothers. In one study, 5-week-old puppies were released into a room with wire enclosures on either side. One side housed the puppies’ mothers and littermates, while the other housed random puppies and adult female dogs. In both instances, the puppies were significantly more likely to walk over to the side of the room with their relatives than the side with strangers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nResearchers hypothesized that these results were based on scent cues, and went on to successfully test this theory by repeating the study using towels with each dog’s scent instead of the dogs themselves. The results were nearly identical. Taking it one step further, they repeated the study with 2-year-old-dogs who hadn’t seen their mothers since they were 8 weeks old to see if recognition stood the test of time. Both mothers and puppies recognized each other more than 75% of the time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese findings may seem heartwarming, but recognition doesn’t necessarily mean that dogs miss or yearn for their relatives when they’re apart. Rather, these studies prove more about the link between recognition and scent cues than an awareness of familial bonds. So yes, dogs recognize their canine relatives.

We feel deeply bonded to the four-legged creatures we share our lives with and often treat them like real children (minus the <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chocolate turkey</a> center pieces). But do our dogs reciprocate our familial feels? This Thanksgiving, we’re digging into the concept of family as it pertains to our pups.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Do dogs recognize their own canine family members?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTechnically, yes. Research shows that dogs exhibit recognition for both their littermates and biological mothers. In one study, 5-week-old puppies were released into a room with wire enclosures on either side. One side housed the puppies’ mothers and littermates, while the other housed random puppies and adult female dogs. In both instances, the puppies were significantly more likely to walk over to the side of the room with their relatives than the side with strangers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nResearchers hypothesized that these results were based on scent cues, and went on to successfully test this theory by repeating the study using towels with each dog’s scent instead of the dogs themselves. The results were nearly identical. Taking it one step further, they repeated the study with 2-year-old-dogs who hadn’t seen their mothers since they were 8 weeks old to see if recognition stood the test of time. Both mothers and puppies recognized each other more than 75% of the time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese findings may seem heartwarming, but recognition doesn’t necessarily mean that dogs miss or yearn for their relatives when they’re apart. Rather, these studies prove more about the link between recognition and scent cues than an awareness of familial bonds. So yes, dogs recognize their canine relatives. But do they feel the same kind of love for their mothers that we feel for them?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do dogs relate to their human families?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere’s actually an encouraging difference between the way dogs recognize familiar dogs and  familiar humans. Scent still drives this type of recognition, but dogs don’t just see humans as another member of their pack.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn one study, a reward response was evoked in the brains of dogs who recognized the scent of a familiar human. This is a completely different response than the one triggered by recognizing another dog. (See: the way your dog acts on the sidewalk, pulling you in the direction of random dogs, while remaining disinterested in passing humans.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn other words, dogs know that humans aren’t<em> </em>like them, but they reserve a special part of their brains for the love and companionship we can provide. They’re not about to flash those <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/puppy-dog-eyes-feel-guilt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puppy eyes</a> at another dog, because they know dogs can’t provide kisses, belly rubs, or bowls of <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delicious food.</a> They love their caretakers because we help them meet fundamental needs they can’t satisfy on their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo this Thanksgiving, while you’re relishing the smell of home (aka butter) with your family, remember: your pup is also forming scent memories.

Luckily he survived his many adventures, but not all dogs are as fortunate.\r\n\r\nHaving a dog go missing is an emotional and challenging experience, but by understanding the many reasons why dogs run away, we can learn to correct and prevent it. Below are a few reasons why your pup might be engaging in this type of behavior, plus tips on how to handle his urge to roam. As always, you should consult with a certified dog trainer to figure out the best approach for your dog’s specific needs.\r\n<h4>Mating</h4>\r\nDogs have a natural instinct to find a mate. Unaltered female dogs produce a very specific scent when they’re in heat, and intact male dogs will often wander off in order to find them. This is an easy “fix;” getting your dog spayed or neutered will not only stop your pet from wandering away, but also help keep the pet population under control.

If they aren’t getting enough <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activity</a> at home, they’ll eventually take it upon themselves to find some elsewhere. Make sure your pup’s environment is stimulating and that you are spending enough playing and <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/decoding-dog-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interacting with him</a>.\r\n<h4>Fear</h4>\r\nStorms, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/save-your-dog-from-summertime-sadness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireworks</a>, and loud noises can all trigger fear in your dog and are potential reasons why he may run off. If your dog is consistently <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">afraid of certain situations</a>, consult your vet for the best course of treatment. Designate a safe, quiet area for your dog or consider medication if your pup needs extra assistance staying calm during especially nerve wracking events.\r\n<h4>New Surroundings</h4>\r\nMoving is chaotic enough without having to account for another being’s emotional state, but don’t forget to consider your pup. It’s challenging for dogs to understand the concept of a new, permanent home and they may try to run back to their old familiar digs. If possible, unpack familiar items first and let your pup acclimate to his new environment slowly. After a bit of time, patience, and plenty of love, he will come to understand that this is his new home.\r\n<h4>Bad Habits</h4>\r\nWe often don’t know a dog’s full history when we adopt and bring him home. If he was able to roam spontaneously before and that freedom has now been taken away, it might be hard for him to learn the new rules. It will take some training and positive reinforcement to correct this kind of behavior, so working with a trainer is recommended.\r\n<h4>Excitement</h4>\r\nJust like little kids running after an ice cream truck, dogs can get easily excited by new distractions and forget their training. Squirrels, other dogs, and cats can all be tempting to chase after. My Labrador, for instance, would often run to construction sites to find workers who would gladly share their lunches with him. To correct this, make sure your dog is leashed while on walks or that your yard is secured.\r\n<h4>Opportunity</h4>\r\nIf your dog digs under the fence or bolts out the front door when it’s open, it may be time to invest in some new systems. Put stones under the fence and always put his leash on before anyone opens the front door.\r\n\r\nNo matter how well you think you know your dog’s behavioral tendencies, it’s important that all dogs are microchipped and always wearing tags. In the unfortunate event that your dog roams a little too far, these precautions will help ensure that whoever locates him can get him back to you.\r\n\r\nIf your dog has gone missing, let local police, shelters, and animal control know right away. You may also want to reach out to local vets, groomers, pet stores, and animal hospitals. Send them a current picture of your pup along with your contact information and the best way to reach you.

After a bit of time, patience, and plenty of love, he will come to understand that this is his new home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Bad Habits</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe often don’t know a dog’s full history when we adopt and bring him home. If he was able to roam spontaneously before and that freedom has now been taken away, it might be hard for him to learn the new rules. It will take some training and positive reinforcement to correct this kind of behavior, so working with a trainer is recommended.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Excitement</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust like little kids running after an ice cream truck, dogs can get easily excited by new distractions and forget their training. Squirrels, other dogs, and cats can all be tempting to chase after. My Labrador, for instance, would often run to construction sites to find workers who would gladly share their lunches with him. To correct this, make sure your dog is leashed while on walks or that your yard is secured.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Opportunity</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog digs under the fence or bolts out the front door when it’s open, it may be time to invest in some new systems. Put stones under the fence and always put his leash on before anyone opens the front door.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNo matter how well you think you know your dog’s behavioral tendencies, it’s important that all dogs are microchipped and always wearing tags. In the unfortunate event that your dog roams a little too far, these precautions will help ensure that whoever locates him can get him back to you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog has gone missing, let local police, shelters, and animal control know right away. You may also want to reach out to local vets, groomers, pet stores, and animal hospitals. Send them a current picture of your pup along with your contact information and the best way to reach you. A community of pet lovers working together has a greater chance of helping reunite you and your best friend.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/therescuerunway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@therescuerunway </a></em>', 'How to keep your dog from running away', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '63-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 12:02:42', '2018-04-09 12:02:42', '', 63, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/63-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(343, 1, '2018-04-09 12:04:33', '2018-04-09 12:04:33', 'Growing up, our family Labrador would run away almost weekly. I still remember jumping in the car and going to search for him, hoping he hadn’t been hurt. Luckily he survived his many adventures, but not all dogs are as fortunate.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHaving a dog go missing is an emotional and challenging experience, but by understanding the many reasons why dogs run away, we can learn to correct and prevent it. Below are a few reasons why your pup might be engaging in this type of behavior, plus tips on how to handle his urge to roam. As always, you should consult with a certified dog trainer to figure out the best approach for your dog’s specific needs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Mating</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDogs have a natural instinct to find a mate. Unaltered female dogs produce a very specific scent when they’re in heat, and intact male dogs will often wander off in order to find them. This is an easy “fix;” getting your dog spayed or neutered will not only stop your pet from wandering away, but also help keep the pet population under control. You can find low-cost clinics in your area <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/low-cost-spayneuter-programs">here</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Boredom</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDogs are social creatures and need regular interaction and mental stimulation to be truly content. If they aren’t getting enough <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activity</a> at home, they’ll eventually take it upon themselves to find some elsewhere. Make sure your pup’s environment is stimulating and that you are spending enough playing and <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/decoding-dog-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interacting with him</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Fear</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStorms, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/save-your-dog-from-summertime-sadness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireworks</a>, and loud noises can all trigger fear in your dog and are potential reasons why he may run off. If your dog is consistently <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">afraid of certain situations</a>, consult your vet for the best course of treatment. Designate a safe, quiet area for your dog or consider medication if your pup needs extra assistance staying calm during especially nerve wracking events.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>New Surroundings</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMoving is chaotic enough without having to account for another being’s emotional state, but don’t forget to consider your pup. It’s challenging for dogs to understand the concept of a new, permanent home and they may try to run back to their old familiar digs. If possible, unpack familiar items first and let your pup acclimate to his new environment slowly. After a bit of time, patience, and plenty of love, he will come to understand that this is his new home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Bad Habits</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe often don’t know a dog’s full history when we adopt and bring him home.

Used both as garnish and an ingredient, parsley comes in several different varieties. Flat-leaf parsley, also known as Italian parsley, has large, flat leaves and adds robust flavors in cooking (think soups, stews, and sauces) while curly parsley is primarily used for decoration. But it’s more than just a pretty face.\r\nThe Stats:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPer tablespoon of chopped herb, parsley contains just 1 calorie and no fat or cholesterol. It contains less than 1 gram of carbohydrates, fiber, and protein but it is fairly rich in Vitamins A, C, and K as well as trace minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Parsley also boasts several volatile oils which have natural anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their antimicrobial and carminative benefits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to parsley for dogs, you should only feed the curly variety. Watch those serving sizes, as parsley does contain a toxic compound called furanocoumarin which can be dangerous in excessive amounts. In smaller servings, however, parsley does your dog more good than harm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Benefits:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Freshens bad breath thanks to microbial properties\r\n2. Rich in antioxidants that protect against free-radical damage\r\n3. Relieves swelling and pain from arthritis and other inflammatory conditions\r\n4. Vitamin K content improves blood clotting and boosts liver health\r\n5. Helps soothe upset stomach and digestive problems\r\n6. Diuretic properties help prevent urinary tract infections\r\n7. Immune system support via Vitamin C\r\n8. Helps flush toxins from the body, supporting kidney health\r\n9. Vitamin A content supports vision and eye health\r\n10. Can slow the rate of growth for tumors and certain cancers\r\nHow to Feed It:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWondering how to incorporate parsley into your dog’s diet? He may not chomp down on a fresh bunch right off the bat, but adding a little to his regular food a few times a week should do the trick. If you’re concerned about accidentally giving your dog too much parsley, play it safe by blending with water (1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight) and creating a juice you can pour right into your his water bowl.

We know to monitor our sodium intake, avoid carrageenan and high fructose corn syrup, and understand that even organic, all-natural potato chips are still chips.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPet food products, however, remain a mystery. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet food marketing</a> aims to paint a picture of health (think: images of farms and fresh vegetables on a shelf-stable bag of brown kibble), and every company promises to be the best option for your dog. It’s tempting to throw in the towel on label vigilance in the pet food aisle and blindly believe the bags, but understanding your dog’s food labels is just as important as carefully examining your own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStep one: learn to recognize the food label tricks that most pet companies are using.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>First ingredient</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust because an ingredient is listed first on a label, doesn’t mean it’s the most potent in the product. Pet food companies know that most consumers are searching for a real meat source in that prized first ingredient slot. It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Natural</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible.

(352, 1, '2018-04-09 12:32:33', '2018-04-09 12:32:33', 'There’s a common misconception that if you aren’t ready to<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-rescue-runways-guide-to-adopting-a-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> adopt a dog</a>, you can’t help a homeless pet. While adoption is one of the biggest ways to make an impact, it’s certainly not the only one. Here are a few creative ways you can get involved and make a real difference in the lives of rescue pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Foster</h5>\r\nMany people can’t commit to a permanent adoption due to busy schedules, traveling, or expenses. Holding off on adopting is a responsible decision when you know you can’t care for an animal long-term, but if you have a two or four week opening on your calendar, fostering might be for you. Plenty of local rescues need foster homes for animals, and sometimes organizations will even pay for all the expenses as long as you can provide love and shelter. It might be hard to say goodbye at the end of the foster stay, but remember that you’ve helped free up space for that organization to take in even more animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Volunteer</h5>\r\nWalk into any shelter and ask if they need help and you’ll be hard pressed to find one that will turn you down. It takes a village to run any nonprofit and when you have animals that need to be cared for, it’s that much more important to have volunteers. Whether you’re looking to help with marketing, fundraising, or simply want to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-importance-of-letting-your-dog-sniff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk dogs</a>, your skill set and time will be put to good use.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Educate</h5>\r\nSo you’re allergic to anything with four legs but still want to help in the plight to save animals. Become an educator! Often times, rescues already have some sort of program in place to educate the community about helping their local pet population. You can go to schools, religious organizations, or businesses and host a discussion on spay/neuter, how to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dangerous-items-dogs-hiding-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">care for pets</a>, and why adoption is important. Education is one of the most powerful tools in the fight against homelessness for pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Fundraise</h5>\r\nIf you like to host events or plan parties, consider organizing a fundraiser for your local shelter. It can be as simple as a bake sale or as extravagant as a gala; anything you can contribute will be an asset. Partner with a local boutique for a Shop Your Cause event, or ask your gym to host a workout fundraiser. Get creative with it and do something that you enjoy. In the end, your local shelter will appreciate whatever amount you raise.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Donate</h5>\r\nIf you’re short on time and resources, skip that latte and donate $5 to a rescue of your choice instead. If you want to make a more direct impact, many organizations have a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/hurricane-harvey-how-to-help/">wish list</a> of items they need. You can usually find these lists under the donations tab on their website, or you can reach out to them directly and ask. Whether you can gift a blanket or a month’s supply of heart worm medication, your donation will help an animal in need.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@butterandwilson</a></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Here’s How to Help Homeless Dogs Without Adopting', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '210-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 12:32:33', '2018-04-09 12:32:33', '', 210, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/210-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

But do you know about the importance of properly balancing your dog’s home cooked meals?\n\nA plate of fresh vegetables, lean protein, and a smart starch may leave <i>you</i> feeling fueled, but there are different guidelines to follow when creating a complete meal for your pet. In other words, that bowl of chicken, spinach, and rice that you’re feeding your dog may actually be doing him more harm than good.\n\nDogs need a nuanced combination of vitamins and minerals to be truly nourished, and it’s extremely difficult for pet owners to come up with balanced recipes or create appropriate meals on their own that are safe for long-term feeding. In an effort to examine this conundrum, a <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/homemade-dog-food-recipes-can-be-risky-business-study-finds">UC Davis study</a> analyzed 200 recipes for dogs using sources like veterinary textbooks, pet care books, and websites. The study revealed that <b>95% of the recipes</b> they examined lacked at least one vital nutrient for dogs, and 83% percent had multiple nutrient deficiencies.\n\nEven home cooked meals supplemented with a multivitamin won’t sufficiently satisfy your dog’s dietary requirements or replicate how certain key ingredients work together to meet your dog’s nutritional needs.\n\nNot convinced? Let’s take a closer look at the most common nutrient deficiencies that can result from an imbalanced homemade diet.\n<h4>Zinc</h4>\nZinc has many essential functions in the body including protein synthesis, skin and wound healing, and stabilizing DNA/RNA structures and cell membranes. We told you it was essential. Although relatively non toxic, zinc can also interfere with the absorption of other minerals if consumed in large quantities, so as is the case with so much in life, balance is key.\n<h4>Choline</h4>\nCholine plays a wide ranging role in your dog’s nutrition and can have a direct impact on liver function. This macronutrient is a structural part of cell membranes and lipoproteins, which are essential for lipid/fat transfer throughout the body. Over time, choline deficiencies can affect normal liver function and lead to the accumulation of fat in the liver.\n<h4>Vitamins D &amp; E</h4>\nThere are two important forms of vitamin D: vitamin D2 (mainly found in plants) and vitamin D3 (which is found in fatty meats and liver). The primary function of vitamin D is to enhance intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus and maintain control of calcium homeostasis within the body.\n\nVitamin E is the major fat-soluble antioxidant present throughout the body and tissues and prevents oxidative damage to cell membranes and DNA/RNA structures. In other words, it’s pretty crucial. Research has shown that vitamin D deficiencies in dogs can lead to rickets and bone deformities, while vitamin E deficiencies manifest as degenerative muscle diseases associated with muscle weakness and reproductive failure. Don’t skimp on this duo.\n<h4>Copper</h4>\nCopper is a trace mineral and is incorporated in a variety of proteins and enzymes which perform essential functions for your dog. These include the formation and maintenance of bone and connective tissue, the formation of red blood cells, and normal nerve fiber formation. Side effects of a copper deficiency include connective tissue disorders and loss of hair pigmentation.\n<h4>Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA &amp; DHA</h4>\nThese babies are a mouthful, but their purpose can be summarized in two words: brain function.  Long chain omega 3 fatty acids (typically found in cold water fish and algae) are important cell membrane components involved in cell signaling and are essential for normal function of the brain and retina.\n<h4>Calcium</h4>\nCalcium serves two major functions: it’s a structural component of bones and teeth and a cellular messenger involved in nerve impulse transmission. Low calcium levels in a dog’s blood — aka hypocalcemia — can become a serious condition resulting in spontaneous bone fractures and nerve damage. Diets containing mainly meat without additional calcium (hey chicken and rice, we’re looking at you) are a common cause of calcium deficiencies.\n\nSo what’s the answer for the pet owner who’s on a mission to feed mindfully? Grocery shopping, cooking, and properly balancing a home cooked diet for your dog can feel like a full-time job (or a science project), but there are a few options for pet owners who want to feed their dog the very best home cooked food:\n\n1. Consult with a board-certified veterinary nutritionist about nutritionally appropriate recipes that are safe for long term feeding.\n\n2. Find a reputable company that can provide you with a <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com/diy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specially formulated vitamin mix</a> and recipe that, together, will create a safe and balanced diet.\n\n3.

But do you know about the importance of properly balancing your dog’s home cooked meals?\r\n\r\nA plate of fresh vegetables, lean protein, and a smart starch may leave <i>you</i> feeling fueled, but there are different guidelines to follow when creating a complete meal for your pet. In other words, that bowl of chicken, spinach, and rice that you’re feeding your dog may actually be doing him more harm than good.\r\n\r\nDogs need a nuanced combination of vitamins and minerals to be truly nourished, and it’s extremely difficult for pet owners to come up with balanced recipes or create appropriate meals on their own that are safe for long-term feeding. In an effort to examine this conundrum, a <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/homemade-dog-food-recipes-can-be-risky-business-study-finds">UC Davis study</a> analyzed 200 recipes for dogs using sources like veterinary textbooks, pet care books, and websites. The study revealed that <b>95% of the recipes</b> they examined lacked at least one vital nutrient for dogs, and 83% percent had multiple nutrient deficiencies.\r\n\r\nEven home cooked meals supplemented with a multivitamin won’t sufficiently satisfy your dog’s dietary requirements or replicate how certain key ingredients work together to meet your dog’s nutritional needs.\r\n\r\nNot convinced? Let’s take a closer look at the most common nutrient deficiencies that can result from an imbalanced homemade diet.\r\n<h4>Zinc</h4>\r\nZinc has many essential functions in the body including protein synthesis, skin and wound healing, and stabilizing DNA/RNA structures and cell membranes. We told you it was essential. Although relatively non toxic, zinc can also interfere with the absorption of other minerals if consumed in large quantities, so as is the case with so much in life, balance is key.\r\n<h4>Choline</h4>\r\nCholine plays a wide ranging role in your dog’s nutrition and can have a direct impact on liver function. This macronutrient is a structural part of cell membranes and lipoproteins, which are essential for lipid/fat transfer throughout the body. Over time, choline deficiencies can affect normal liver function and lead to the accumulation of fat in the liver.\r\n<h4>Vitamins D &amp; E</h4>\r\nThere are two important forms of vitamin D: vitamin D2 (mainly found in plants) and vitamin D3 (which is found in fatty meats and liver). The primary function of vitamin D is to enhance intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus and maintain control of calcium homeostasis within the body.\r\n\r\nVitamin E is the major fat-soluble antioxidant present throughout the body and tissues and prevents oxidative damage to cell membranes and DNA/RNA structures. In other words, it’s pretty crucial. Research has shown that vitamin D deficiencies in dogs can lead to rickets and bone deformities, while vitamin E deficiencies manifest as degenerative muscle diseases associated with muscle weakness and reproductive failure. Don’t skimp on this duo.\r\n<h4>Copper</h4>\r\nCopper is a trace mineral and is incorporated in a variety of proteins and enzymes which perform essential functions for your dog. These include the formation and maintenance of bone and connective tissue, the formation of red blood cells, and normal nerve fiber formation. Side effects of a copper deficiency include connective tissue disorders and loss of hair pigmentation.\r\n<h4>Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA &amp; DHA</h4>\r\nThese babies are a mouthful, but their purpose can be summarized in two words: brain function.  Long chain omega 3 fatty acids (typically found in cold water fish and algae) are important cell membrane components involved in cell signaling and are essential for normal function of the brain and retina.\r\n<h4>Calcium</h4>\r\nCalcium serves two major functions: it’s a structural component of bones and teeth and a cellular messenger involved in nerve impulse transmission. Low calcium levels in a dog’s blood — aka hypocalcemia — can become a serious condition resulting in spontaneous bone fractures and nerve damage. Diets containing mainly meat without additional calcium (hey chicken and rice, we’re looking at you) are a common cause of calcium deficiencies.\r\n\r\nSo what’s the answer for the pet owner who’s on a mission to feed mindfully? Grocery shopping, cooking, and properly balancing a home cooked diet for your dog can feel like a full-time job (or a science project), but there are a few options for pet owners who want to feed their dog the very best home cooked food:\r\n\r\n1. Consult with a board-certified veterinary nutritionist about nutritionally appropriate recipes that are safe for long term feeding.\r\n\r\n2. Find a reputable company that can provide you with a <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com/diy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specially formulated vitamin mix</a> and recipe that, together, will create a safe and balanced diet.\r\n\r\n3.
