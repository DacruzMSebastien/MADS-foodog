(30, 1, '2018-03-28 08:58:50', '2018-03-28 08:58:50', 'My dogs have two moods: manic and sleepy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe live in a ranch with a long hallway that stretches from one end of the house to the other, and in their most manic moments my dogs like to sprint back and forth, breathlessly racing each other to an invisible finish line. They spend the rest of their days sprawled out on our wooden floors in a way that honestly makes them look pretty dead.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut there’s a big difference between dogs who enjoy snoozing in a patch of sunlight after a long day of sprints and ones who are consistently lethargic. Not sure which camp your dog lies in? Let’s take a look.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Signs of lethargy</em> in dogs include napping way more than usual and a diminished interest in eating or drinking. Lethargic dogs can also have delayed responses to external stimuli, like someone calling their name or tossing them a tennis ball. In other words, dogs get dazed and confused, too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour dog might be lethargic after a particularly long day and can perk back up in as little as 24 hours, but if you notice signs of lethargy for days at a time, you might want to consider other causes. Like in humans, lethargy in dogs can be caused by both physical and mental issues like <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/causes-of-dog-diarrhea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diarrhea</a>, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>, and infection, as well as <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> and depression. When coupled with any of these ailments, lethargy is a sign that it’s time to see the vet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are at-home ways to improve your dog’s energy levels, too. An <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improperly balanced</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly processed</a> diet can lead to the same sluggish feelings of lethargy you experience after eating pasta for three days straight. Consider adding fresh foods like  <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vegetables </a>(or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/sardines-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sardines</a> if you’re feeling creative) to your dog’s bowl for a boost of nutrients and energy. Research shows that fresh food can help build strong immunity and increase vitality in dogs, so you can also switch your pup to a regular diet of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real, unprocessed food</a> to kick that 3pm slump for good.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA Saturday in bed is necessary every once in a while, but we all know fitness is in and the same goes for your dog. Adding extra <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercise to your dog’s routine</a> can help balance energy levels and give you both a little more pep in your step. What you do with that energy (like, say, sprinting down hallways until you pass out) is up to you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a class="_2g7d5 notranslate _iadoq" title="theobonaparte" href="https://www.instagram.com/theobonaparte/">@theobonaparte</a></em>', 'Why is my dog so lethargic?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'why-is-my-dog-so-lethargic', '', '', '2018-04-09 10:17:12', '2018-04-09 10:17:12', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=30', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(34, 1, '2018-03-28 10:13:17', '2018-03-28 10:13:17', 'Halloween can be a stressful holiday for pet owners, with the doorbell sending most dogs into a tailspin as trick or treaters arrive en masse. In addition to the emotional distress that Halloween can cause, that bowl of candy by the front door is also treacherous for any pet. Keep your dog away from these tricks in the treat bucket this Halloween.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Chocolate</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhether or not you have kids, chocolate is bound to make its way into your house this Halloween. Most dog owners are already aware of the dangers of chocolate for dogs, but here’s a quick refresher. The villain is a molecule found in chocolate known as <em>theobromine,</em> which is very difficult for dogs to digest. Not all chocolate is equally poisonous; dark chocolate contains more than six times the amount of the deadly molecule than milk chocolate, which means those Kit Kat Halloween Darkness candies are especially spooky. Smaller dogs are at a greater risk of getting sick than bigger breeds, and symptoms include vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, and increased heart rate. If ingested in large quantities, this sinister treat can lead to death, so keep that candy bowl far out of reach.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Garlic</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGarlic is a key weapon in the fight against vampires, but it can also have adverse effects on your dog’s health. Garlic contains thiosulfate which damages red blood cells and can cause anemia. This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Raisins</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Candy</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach. Instead of chocolate or candy, chop up some <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh treats</a> for your dog to enjoy, like apples or carrots.

Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\r\n<h5><strong>Why do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. teeth, nails, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>Grooming by coat type</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog? Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome dogs also have an undercoat, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How does your dog’s diet affect coat health?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair. The important ones here are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (both of which you can find in superfoods like olive oil!). Omega-3s help to reduce general inflammation, which can cut down on dander and combat any bites or allergies, while omega-6s stimulate hair growth. A healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids ultimately results in a strong and lustrous coat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you think your dog might have an omega-3 or omega-6 deficiency, you can supplement his diet with fish or flaxseed oil or switch to a fresh, balanced meal plan. If you’re home cooking for your dog or supplementing yourself, check in with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure that you’re feeding a balanced diet. Brushing, bathing, and feeding your dog right?

They spend the rest of their days sprawled out on our wooden floors in a way that honestly makes them look pretty dead.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut there’s a big difference between dogs who enjoy snoozing in a patch of sunlight after a long day of sprints and ones who are consistently lethargic. Not sure which camp your dog lies in? Let’s take a look.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Signs of lethargy</em> in dogs include napping way more than usual and a diminished interest in eating or drinking. Lethargic dogs can also have delayed responses to external stimuli, like someone calling their name or tossing them a tennis ball. In other words, dogs get dazed and confused, too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour dog might be lethargic after a particularly long day and can perk back up in as little as 24 hours, but if you notice signs of lethargy for days at a time, you might want to consider other causes. Like in humans, lethargy in dogs can be caused by both physical and mental issues like <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/causes-of-dog-diarrhea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diarrhea</a>, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>, and infection, as well as <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> and depression. When coupled with any of these ailments, lethargy is a sign that it’s time to see the vet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are at-home ways to improve your dog’s energy levels, too. An <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improperly balanced</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly processed</a> diet can lead to the same sluggish feelings of lethargy you experience after eating pasta for three days straight. Consider adding fresh foods like  <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vegetables </a>(or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/sardines-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sardines</a> if you’re feeling creative) to your dog’s bowl for a boost of nutrients and energy. Research shows that fresh food can help build strong immunity and increase vitality in dogs, so you can also switch your pup to a regular diet of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real, unprocessed food</a> to kick that 3pm slump for good.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA Saturday in bed is necessary every once in a while, but we all know fitness is in and the same goes for your dog. Adding extra <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercise to your dog’s routine</a> can help balance energy levels and give you both a little more pep in your step.

(43, 1, '2018-03-28 10:21:08', '2018-03-28 10:21:08', 'Halloween can be a stressful holiday for pet owners, with the doorbell sending most dogs into a tailspin as trick or treaters arrive en masse. In addition to the emotional distress that Halloween can cause, that bowl of candy by the front door is also treacherous for any pet. Keep your dog away from these tricks in the treat bucket this Halloween.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Chocolate</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhether or not you have kids, chocolate is bound to make its way into your house this Halloween. Most dog owners are already aware of the dangers of chocolate for dogs, but here’s a quick refresher. The villain is a molecule found in chocolate known as <em>theobromine,</em> which is very difficult for dogs to digest. Not all chocolate is equally poisonous; dark chocolate contains more than six times the amount of the deadly molecule than milk chocolate, which means those Kit Kat Halloween Darkness candies are especially spooky. Smaller dogs are at a greater risk of getting sick than bigger breeds, and symptoms include vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, and increased heart rate. If ingested in large quantities, this sinister treat can lead to death, so keep that candy bowl far out of reach.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Garlic</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGarlic is a key weapon in the fight against vampires, but it can also have adverse effects on your dog’s health. Garlic contains thiosulfate which damages red blood cells and can cause anemia. This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Raisins</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Candy</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach. Instead of chocolate or candy, chop up some <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh treats</a> for your dog to enjoy, like apples or carrots. They may not be as decadent as your treats, but your dog’s health is a far better investment.

We feel deeply bonded to the four-legged creatures we share our lives with and often treat them like real children (minus the <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chocolate turkey</a> center pieces). But do our dogs reciprocate our familial feels? This Thanksgiving, we’re digging into the concept of family as it pertains to our pups.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Do dogs recognize their own canine family members?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTechnically, yes. Research shows that dogs exhibit recognition for both their littermates and biological mothers. In one study, 5-week-old puppies were released into a room with wire enclosures on either side. One side housed the puppies’ mothers and littermates, while the other housed random puppies and adult female dogs. In both instances, the puppies were significantly more likely to walk over to the side of the room with their relatives than the side with strangers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nResearchers hypothesized that these results were based on scent cues, and went on to successfully test this theory by repeating the study using towels with each dog’s scent instead of the dogs themselves. The results were nearly identical. Taking it one step further, they repeated the study with 2-year-old-dogs who hadn’t seen their mothers since they were 8 weeks old to see if recognition stood the test of time. Both mothers and puppies recognized each other more than 75% of the time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese findings may seem heartwarming, but recognition doesn’t necessarily mean that dogs miss or yearn for their relatives when they’re apart. Rather, these studies prove more about the link between recognition and scent cues than an awareness of familial bonds. So yes, dogs recognize their canine relatives. But do they feel the same kind of love for their mothers that we feel for them?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do dogs relate to their human families?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere’s actually an encouraging difference between the way dogs recognize familiar dogs and  familiar humans. Scent still drives this type of recognition, but dogs don’t just see humans as another member of their pack.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn one study, a reward response was evoked in the brains of dogs who recognized the scent of a familiar human. This is a completely different response than the one triggered by recognizing another dog.

Happier employees = more productive employees.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3. Having a dog-friendly workplace creates a welcoming and warm energy, which can help with team building and recruiting. Allowing employees to bring their dogs to work also cuts the potential cost of dog walkers and daycare from their budgets, enabling them to save money five days a week.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n4. On a similar note, letting employees bring dogs to work removes the stress of tight time constraints — there’s less pressure to run home to feed or walk the dog at the end of the day. One 2008 survey of both small and big companies showed that dog-friendly offices had employees who were willing to work longer hours as well as lower rates of employee absenteeism. Employees working alongside their dogs are more inclined to stick around, finish work without feeling rushed, and go home when they’re ready.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n5. Like I said before, this is all backed by #science. <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/study-office-dogs-reduce-work-related-stress.html">A 2012 study</a> from Virginia Commonwealth University found that employees surrounded by dogs in the workplace were less stressed than those who left their pets at home. Randolph Barker, a leader on <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/17538351211215366">the VCU study</a> published in the International Journal of Workplace Health Management, described the outcome as a “low cost wellness benefit.” (I’m nailing economic theory right now.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n6. In the same study, researchers found that employees with in-office dogs reported higher productivity. Both of these benefits might be attributed to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone that decreases stress in the human body. Oxytocin, also known as the “cuddle hormone,” is released when bonding socially, snuggling, or petting and interacting with animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n7. Dogs foster a more collaborative work environment. Who needs a water cooler when you can gather ‘round a dog? Meet your cute new co-worker over a petting sesh.

Walking, feeding, or playing with a dog is a nice way to <a href="https://www.inc.com/jordan-smith/companies-find-stress-reducing-benefits-of-office-dogs.html">break up your work day</a>.

Therapy dogs go a step even further, as they can help improve a host of mental and physical ailments. Here is a closer look at what therapy dogs do, the science behind their efficacy, and the steps you can take to get <em>your</em> pup certified.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What is a therapy dog?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor starters, a therapy dog is not the same thing as a service dog (it’s also not a dog with a prescription pad and PhD). A service dog is trained to provide assistance to someone with a specific disability such as blindness, epilepsy, or PTSD. This is essentially a full-time job for that dog, as his owner is usually the person for whom he provides this particular service.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA therapy dog needs training as well, but it tends to be more generalized and temperament-centric than, say, the very specific way a service dog is trained to protect his owner’s head during a seizure. Therapy dogs visit hospitals, assisted living facilities, college campuses, and even prisons, and provide love, comfort, and companionship.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou know when you’ve had a bad day at work so you walk by the pet store on your way home and spend 30 minutes watching puppies playing in the window? It’s a lot like that, on a more institutional level.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What is the science behind therapy dogs?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn addition to their winning combination of loyalty and fluffiness, dogs have been scientifically shown to make <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/5-ways-your-dog-is-making-you-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans healthier.</a> Therapy dogs in particular are proven to:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Reduce blood pressure\r\n</strong>High blood pressure (or hypertension) is a major risk for heart disease and stroke, so reduced blood pressure is tremendously important. Patients in assisted living facilities or hospitals may see lower blood pressure levels after spending extended periods of time petting a dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Increase both endorphins and oxytocin\r\n</strong>Endorphins are essentially a naturally occurring form of morphine, inducing a little jolt of euphoria when activated (think: the high you feel after going on a long run). Oxytocin is also a very powerful hormone – often called “the love hormone” – and gets triggered when you hug or kiss a loved one (or see a friendly tail wagging your way). It’s also believed to be the chemical backbone that underlies the feeling of trust.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lower cortisol levels\r\n</strong>Cortisol is a steroid hormone released in response to stress, and it mostly works to increase blood sugar and assist in the metabolism of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Things like massage therapy and laughter <em>lower</em> cortisol levels, while caffeine, sleep deprivation, and severe trauma <em>increase</em> them. Which category would you rather fall into?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOf course, not <em>every</em> dog has the temperament to be a therapy dog. My own dog, for example, has such an <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense fear of strangers</a> that most interactions lead to skyrocketing blood pressures for all parties involved. This, among other reasons, is why he won’t be signing up for therapy duty anytime soon. Think your dog has what it takes?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How can my pup become a therapy dog?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you’re thinking about turning your dog into a charitable super hero, he’ll need to exhibit a few prerequisites. Is your dog naturally calm and friendly around strangers? Do crowds, loud noises, and sudden movements give him anxiety? Has he received (and excelled in) at least basic obedience training?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf the answer to all of the above is yes, then congratulations! You’re on your way to becoming a dynamic therapy duo (you, as the handler, are an important part of this equation too). To become a licensed therapy dog, you and your pup will need to pass a test and get certified by an official registry. Though the specifics of the test will vary between registries, most tests gauge your dog’s ability to sit, stay, walk through a crowd, and respond to other commands.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce you’re registered and ready to go, you can ask your registry for a list or simply reach out to hospitals, nursing homes, or any other group you feel could benefit from quality time with your newly anointed therapy dog. The world is your oyster; some therapy dogs even visit children’s libraries and sit with kids who are learning to read. Your dog’s patient, nonjudgmental gaze can help a child develop the confidence he or she will need to continue improving those reading skills.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou might not be able to heal the world, but your dog’s love and companionship can help brighten it. And if nothing else, it will give him a reason to work for those treats.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gralizzybear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@gralizzybear</a> </em>', 'How your therapy dog can change someone\'s life', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-your-therapy-dog-can-change-someones-life', '', '', '2018-04-09 11:49:31', '2018-04-09 11:49:31', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=53', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(55, 1, '2018-03-28 12:58:46', '2018-03-28 12:58:46', 'Growing up, our family Labrador would run away almost weekly. I still remember jumping in the car and going to search for him, hoping he hadn’t been hurt. Luckily he survived his many adventures, but not all dogs are as fortunate.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHaving a dog go missing is an emotional and challenging experience, but by understanding the many reasons why dogs run away, we can learn to correct and prevent it. Below are a few reasons why your pup might be engaging in this type of behavior, plus tips on how to handle his urge to roam. As always, you should consult with a certified dog trainer to figure out the best approach for your dog’s specific needs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Mating</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDogs have a natural instinct to find a mate. Unaltered female dogs produce a very specific scent when they’re in heat, and intact male dogs will often wander off in order to find them. This is an easy “fix;” getting your dog spayed or neutered will not only stop your pet from wandering away, but also help keep the pet population under control. You can find low-cost clinics in your area <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/low-cost-spayneuter-programs">here</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Boredom</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDogs are social creatures and need regular interaction and mental stimulation to be truly content. If they aren’t getting enough <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activity</a> at home, they’ll eventually take it upon themselves to find some elsewhere. Make sure your pup’s environment is stimulating and that you are spending enough playing and <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/decoding-dog-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interacting with him</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Fear</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStorms, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/save-your-dog-from-summertime-sadness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireworks</a>, and loud noises can all trigger fear in your dog and are potential reasons why he may run off. If your dog is consistently <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">afraid of certain situations</a>, consult your vet for the best course of treatment. Designate a safe, quiet area for your dog or consider medication if your pup needs extra assistance staying calm during especially nerve wracking events.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>New Surroundings</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMoving is chaotic enough without having to account for another being’s emotional state, but don’t forget to consider your pup. It’s challenging for dogs to understand the concept of a new, permanent home and they may try to run back to their old familiar digs. If possible, unpack familiar items first and let your pup acclimate to his new environment slowly. After a bit of time, patience, and plenty of love, he will come to understand that this is his new home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Bad Habits</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe often don’t know a dog’s full history when we adopt and bring him home. If he was able to roam spontaneously before and that freedom has now been taken away, it might be hard for him to learn the new rules. It will take some training and positive reinforcement to correct this kind of behavior, so working with a trainer is recommended.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Excitement</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust like little kids running after an ice cream truck, dogs can get easily excited by new distractions and forget their training. Squirrels, other dogs, and cats can all be tempting to chase after. My Labrador, for instance, would often run to construction sites to find workers who would gladly share their lunches with him. To correct this, make sure your dog is leashed while on walks or that your yard is secured.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Opportunity</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog digs under the fence or bolts out the front door when it’s open, it may be time to invest in some new systems. Put stones under the fence and always put his leash on before anyone opens the front door.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNo matter how well you think you know your dog’s behavioral tendencies, it’s important that all dogs are microchipped and always wearing tags. In the unfortunate event that your dog roams a little too far, these precautions will help ensure that whoever locates him can get him back to you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog has gone missing, let local police, shelters, and animal control know right away. You may also want to reach out to local vets, groomers, pet stores, and animal hospitals. Send them a current picture of your pup along with your contact information and the best way to reach you. A community of pet lovers working together has a greater chance of helping reunite you and your best friend.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/therescuerunway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@therescuerunway </a></em>', 'How to keep your dog from running away', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-to-keep-your-dog-from-running-away', '', '', '2018-04-09 12:04:33', '2018-04-09 12:04:33', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=55', 0, 'post', '', 0),

We feel deeply bonded to the four-legged creatures we share our lives with and often treat them like real children (minus the <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chocolate turkey</a> center pieces). But do our dogs reciprocate our familial feels? This Thanksgiving, we’re digging into the concept of family as it pertains to our pups.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Do dogs recognize their own canine family members?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTechnically, yes. Research shows that dogs exhibit recognition for both their littermates and biological mothers. In one study, 5-week-old puppies were released into a room with wire enclosures on either side. One side housed the puppies’ mothers and littermates, while the other housed random puppies and adult female dogs. In both instances, the puppies were significantly more likely to walk over to the side of the room with their relatives than the side with strangers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nResearchers hypothesized that these results were based on scent cues, and went on to successfully test this theory by repeating the study using towels with each dog’s scent instead of the dogs themselves. The results were nearly identical. Taking it one step further, they repeated the study with 2-year-old-dogs who hadn’t seen their mothers since they were 8 weeks old to see if recognition stood the test of time. Both mothers and puppies recognized each other more than 75% of the time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese findings may seem heartwarming, but recognition doesn’t necessarily mean that dogs miss or yearn for their relatives when they’re apart. Rather, these studies prove more about the link between recognition and scent cues than an awareness of familial bonds. So yes, dogs recognize their canine relatives. But do they feel the same kind of love for their mothers that we feel for them?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do dogs relate to their human families?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere’s actually an encouraging difference between the way dogs recognize familiar dogs and  familiar humans. Scent still drives this type of recognition, but dogs don’t just see humans as another member of their pack.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn one study, a reward response was evoked in the brains of dogs who recognized the scent of a familiar human. This is a completely different response than the one triggered by recognizing another dog. (See: the way your dog acts on the sidewalk, pulling you in the direction of random dogs, while remaining disinterested in passing humans.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn other words, dogs know that humans aren’t<em> </em>like them, but they reserve a special part of their brains for the love and companionship we can provide. They’re not about to flash those <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/puppy-dog-eyes-feel-guilt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puppy eyes</a> at another dog, because they know dogs can’t provide kisses, belly rubs, or bowls of <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delicious food.</a> They love their caretakers because we help them meet fundamental needs they can’t satisfy on their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo this Thanksgiving, while you’re relishing the smell of home (aka butter) with your family, remember: your pup is also forming scent memories.

A service dog is trained to provide assistance to someone with a specific disability such as blindness, epilepsy, or PTSD. This is essentially a full-time job for that dog, as his owner is usually the person for whom he provides this particular service.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA therapy dog needs training as well, but it tends to be more generalized and temperament-centric than, say, the very specific way a service dog is trained to protect his owner’s head during a seizure. Therapy dogs visit hospitals, assisted living facilities, college campuses, and even prisons, and provide love, comfort, and companionship.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou know when you’ve had a bad day at work so you walk by the pet store on your way home and spend 30 minutes watching puppies playing in the window? It’s a lot like that, on a more institutional level.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What is the science behind therapy dogs?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn addition to their winning combination of loyalty and fluffiness, dogs have been scientifically shown to make <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/5-ways-your-dog-is-making-you-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans healthier.</a> Therapy dogs in particular are proven to:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Reduce blood pressure\r\n</strong>High blood pressure (or hypertension) is a major risk for heart disease and stroke, so reduced blood pressure is tremendously important. Patients in assisted living facilities or hospitals may see lower blood pressure levels after spending extended periods of time petting a dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Increase both endorphins and oxytocin\r\n</strong>Endorphins are essentially a naturally occurring form of morphine, inducing a little jolt of euphoria when activated (think: the high you feel after going on a long run). Oxytocin is also a very powerful hormone – often called “the love hormone” – and gets triggered when you hug or kiss a loved one (or see a friendly tail wagging your way). It’s also believed to be the chemical backbone that underlies the feeling of trust.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lower cortisol levels\r\n</strong>Cortisol is a steroid hormone released in response to stress, and it mostly works to increase blood sugar and assist in the metabolism of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Things like massage therapy and laughter <em>lower</em> cortisol levels, while caffeine, sleep deprivation, and severe trauma <em>increase</em> them. Which category would you rather fall into?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOf course, not <em>every</em> dog has the temperament to be a therapy dog. My own dog, for example, has such an <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense fear of strangers</a> that most interactions lead to skyrocketing blood pressures for all parties involved.

Think your dog has what it takes?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How can my pup become a therapy dog?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you’re thinking about turning your dog into a charitable super hero, he’ll need to exhibit a few prerequisites. Is your dog naturally calm and friendly around strangers? Do crowds, loud noises, and sudden movements give him anxiety? Has he received (and excelled in) at least basic obedience training?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf the answer to all of the above is yes, then congratulations! You’re on your way to becoming a dynamic therapy duo (you, as the handler, are an important part of this equation too). To become a licensed therapy dog, you and your pup will need to pass a test and get certified by an official registry.

The world is your oyster; some therapy dogs even visit children’s libraries and sit with kids who are learning to read. Your dog’s patient, nonjudgmental gaze can help a child develop the confidence he or she will need to continue improving those reading skills.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou might not be able to heal the world, but your dog’s love and companionship can help brighten it.

(63, 1, '2018-03-28 13:01:52', '2018-03-28 13:01:52', 'Growing up, our family Labrador would run away almost weekly. I still remember jumping in the car and going to search for him, hoping he hadn’t been hurt. Luckily he survived his many adventures, but not all dogs are as fortunate.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHaving a dog go missing is an emotional and challenging experience, but by understanding the many reasons why dogs run away, we can learn to correct and prevent it. Below are a few reasons why your pup might be engaging in this type of behavior, plus tips on how to handle his urge to roam. As always, you should consult with a certified dog trainer to figure out the best approach for your dog’s specific needs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Mating</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDogs have a natural instinct to find a mate. Unaltered female dogs produce a very specific scent when they’re in heat, and intact male dogs will often wander off in order to find them. This is an easy “fix;” getting your dog spayed or neutered will not only stop your pet from wandering away, but also help keep the pet population under control. You can find low-cost clinics in your area <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/low-cost-spayneuter-programs">here</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Boredom</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDogs are social creatures and need regular interaction and mental stimulation to be truly content. If they aren’t getting enough <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activity</a> at home, they’ll eventually take it upon themselves to find some elsewhere. Make sure your pup’s environment is stimulating and that you are spending enough playing and <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/decoding-dog-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interacting with him</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Fear</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStorms, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/save-your-dog-from-summertime-sadness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireworks</a>, and loud noises can all trigger fear in your dog and are potential reasons why he may run off. If your dog is consistently <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">afraid of certain situations</a>, consult your vet for the best course of treatment. Designate a safe, quiet area for your dog or consider medication if your pup needs extra assistance staying calm during especially nerve wracking events.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>New Surroundings</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMoving is chaotic enough without having to account for another being’s emotional state, but don’t forget to consider your pup. It’s challenging for dogs to understand the concept of a new, permanent home and they may try to run back to their old familiar digs. If possible, unpack familiar items first and let your pup acclimate to his new environment slowly. After a bit of time, patience, and plenty of love, he will come to understand that this is his new home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Bad Habits</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe often don’t know a dog’s full history when we adopt and bring him home. If he was able to roam spontaneously before and that freedom has now been taken away, it might be hard for him to learn the new rules. It will take some training and positive reinforcement to correct this kind of behavior, so working with a trainer is recommended.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Excitement</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust like little kids running after an ice cream truck, dogs can get easily excited by new distractions and forget their training. Squirrels, other dogs, and cats can all be tempting to chase after. My Labrador, for instance, would often run to construction sites to find workers who would gladly share their lunches with him. To correct this, make sure your dog is leashed while on walks or that your yard is secured.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Opportunity</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog digs under the fence or bolts out the front door when it’s open, it may be time to invest in some new systems. Put stones under the fence and always put his leash on before anyone opens the front door.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNo matter how well you think you know your dog’s behavioral tendencies, it’s important that all dogs are microchipped and always wearing tags. In the unfortunate event that your dog roams a little too far, these precautions will help ensure that whoever locates him can get him back to you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog has gone missing, let local police, shelters, and animal control know right away. You may also want to reach out to local vets, groomers, pet stores, and animal hospitals. Send them a current picture of your pup along with your contact information and the best way to reach you. A community of pet lovers working together has a greater chance of helping reunite you and your best friend.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/therescuerunway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@therescuerunway </a></em>', 'How to keep your dog from running away', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-to-keep-your-dog-from-running-away-2', '', '', '2018-04-09 12:02:42', '2018-04-09 12:02:42', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=63', 0, 'post', '', 0),

We feel deeply bonded to the four-legged creatures we share our lives with and often treat them like real children (minus the <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chocolate turkey</a> center pieces). But do our dogs reciprocate our familial feels? This Thanksgiving, we’re digging into the concept of family as it pertains to our pups.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Do dogs recognize their own canine family members?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTechnically, yes. Research shows that dogs exhibit recognition for both their littermates and biological mothers. In one study, 5-week-old puppies were released into a room with wire enclosures on either side. One side housed the puppies’ mothers and littermates, while the other housed random puppies and adult female dogs. In both instances, the puppies were significantly more likely to walk over to the side of the room with their relatives than the side with strangers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nResearchers hypothesized that these results were based on scent cues, and went on to successfully test this theory by repeating the study using towels with each dog’s scent instead of the dogs themselves. The results were nearly identical. Taking it one step further, they repeated the study with 2-year-old-dogs who hadn’t seen their mothers since they were 8 weeks old to see if recognition stood the test of time. Both mothers and puppies recognized each other more than 75% of the time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese findings may seem heartwarming, but recognition doesn’t necessarily mean that dogs miss or yearn for their relatives when they’re apart. Rather, these studies prove more about the link between recognition and scent cues than an awareness of familial bonds. So yes, dogs recognize their canine relatives. But do they feel the same kind of love for their mothers that we feel for them?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do dogs relate to their human families?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere’s actually an encouraging difference between the way dogs recognize familiar dogs and  familiar humans. Scent still drives this type of recognition, but dogs don’t just see humans as another member of their pack.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn one study, a reward response was evoked in the brains of dogs who recognized the scent of a familiar human. This is a completely different response than the one triggered by recognizing another dog. (See: the way your dog acts on the sidewalk, pulling you in the direction of random dogs, while remaining disinterested in passing humans.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn other words, dogs know that humans aren’t<em> </em>like them, but they reserve a special part of their brains for the love and companionship we can provide. They’re not about to flash those <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/puppy-dog-eyes-feel-guilt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puppy eyes</a> at another dog, because they know dogs can’t provide kisses, belly rubs, or bowls of <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delicious food.</a> They love their caretakers because we help them meet fundamental needs they can’t satisfy on their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo this Thanksgiving, while you’re relishing the smell of home (aka butter) with your family, remember: your pup is also forming scent memories. They just have less to do with turkey and more to do with loving you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gralizzybear/">@gralizzybear</a></em>', 'What family really means to your dog', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'what-family-really-means-to-your-dog-3', '', '', '2018-04-09 11:51:33', '2018-04-09 11:51:33', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=66', 0, 'post', '', 0),

I majored in English.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDon’t believe me? Over the next few months we’ll be interviewing people from a variety of cities and industries about how bringing their working dogs to the office has impacted their lives, careers, and mental health. But first, a word from science.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Benefits of dogs in the workplace:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dogs make everything better. Even Excel spreadsheets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2. Happier employees = more productive employees.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3. Having a dog-friendly workplace creates a welcoming and warm energy, which can help with team building and recruiting. Allowing employees to bring their dogs to work also cuts the potential cost of dog walkers and daycare from their budgets, enabling them to save money five days a week.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n4. On a similar note, letting employees bring dogs to work removes the stress of tight time constraints — there’s less pressure to run home to feed or walk the dog at the end of the day. One 2008 survey of both small and big companies showed that dog-friendly offices had employees who were willing to work longer hours as well as lower rates of employee absenteeism. Employees working alongside their dogs are more inclined to stick around, finish work without feeling rushed, and go home when they’re ready.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n5. Like I said before, this is all backed by #science. <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/study-office-dogs-reduce-work-related-stress.html">A 2012 study</a> from Virginia Commonwealth University found that employees surrounded by dogs in the workplace were less stressed than those who left their pets at home. Randolph Barker, a leader on <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/17538351211215366">the VCU study</a> published in the International Journal of Workplace Health Management, described the outcome as a “low cost wellness benefit.” (I’m nailing economic theory right now.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n6. In the same study, researchers found that employees with in-office dogs reported higher productivity. Both of these benefits might be attributed to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone that decreases stress in the human body. Oxytocin, also known as the “cuddle hormone,” is released when bonding socially, snuggling, or petting and interacting with animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n7. Dogs foster a more collaborative work environment. Who needs a water cooler when you can gather ‘round a dog? Meet your cute new co-worker over a petting sesh. Everyone bonds over belly rubs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n8.

I still remember jumping in the car and going to search for him, hoping he hadn’t been hurt. Luckily he survived his many adventures, but not all dogs are as fortunate.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHaving a dog go missing is an emotional and challenging experience, but by understanding the many reasons why dogs run away, we can learn to correct and prevent it. Below are a few reasons why your pup might be engaging in this type of behavior, plus tips on how to handle his urge to roam. As always, you should consult with a certified dog trainer to figure out the best approach for your dog’s specific needs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Mating</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDogs have a natural instinct to find a mate. Unaltered female dogs produce a very specific scent when they’re in heat, and intact male dogs will often wander off in order to find them. This is an easy “fix;” getting your dog spayed or neutered will not only stop your pet from wandering away, but also help keep the pet population under control. You can find low-cost clinics in your area <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/low-cost-spayneuter-programs">here</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Boredom</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDogs are social creatures and need regular interaction and mental stimulation to be truly content. If they aren’t getting enough <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activity</a> at home, they’ll eventually take it upon themselves to find some elsewhere. Make sure your pup’s environment is stimulating and that you are spending enough playing and <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/decoding-dog-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interacting with him</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Fear</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStorms, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/save-your-dog-from-summertime-sadness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireworks</a>, and loud noises can all trigger fear in your dog and are potential reasons why he may run off. If your dog is consistently <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">afraid of certain situations</a>, consult your vet for the best course of treatment. Designate a safe, quiet area for your dog or consider medication if your pup needs extra assistance staying calm during especially nerve wracking events.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>New Surroundings</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMoving is chaotic enough without having to account for another being’s emotional state, but don’t forget to consider your pup. It’s challenging for dogs to understand the concept of a new, permanent home and they may try to run back to their old familiar digs. If possible, unpack familiar items first and let your pup acclimate to his new environment slowly. After a bit of time, patience, and plenty of love, he will come to understand that this is his new home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Bad Habits</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe often don’t know a dog’s full history when we adopt and bring him home. If he was able to roam spontaneously before and that freedom has now been taken away, it might be hard for him to learn the new rules. It will take some training and positive reinforcement to correct this kind of behavior, so working with a trainer is recommended.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Excitement</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust like little kids running after an ice cream truck, dogs can get easily excited by new distractions and forget their training. Squirrels, other dogs, and cats can all be tempting to chase after. My Labrador, for instance, would often run to construction sites to find workers who would gladly share their lunches with him. To correct this, make sure your dog is leashed while on walks or that your yard is secured.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Opportunity</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog digs under the fence or bolts out the front door when it’s open, it may be time to invest in some new systems. Put stones under the fence and always put his leash on before anyone opens the front door.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNo matter how well you think you know your dog’s behavioral tendencies, it’s important that all dogs are microchipped and always wearing tags. In the unfortunate event that your dog roams a little too far, these precautions will help ensure that whoever locates him can get him back to you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog has gone missing, let local police, shelters, and animal control know right away. You may also want to reach out to local vets, groomers, pet stores, and animal hospitals. Send them a current picture of your pup along with your contact information and the best way to reach you. A community of pet lovers working together has a greater chance of helping reunite you and your best friend.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/therescuerunway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@therescuerunway </a></em>', 'How to keep your dog from running away', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-to-keep-your-dog-from-running-away-3', '', '', '2018-04-09 11:56:02', '2018-04-09 11:56:02', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=72', 0, 'post', '', 0),

We feel deeply bonded to the four-legged creatures we share our lives with and often treat them like real children (minus the <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chocolate turkey</a> center pieces). But do our dogs reciprocate our familial feels? This Thanksgiving, we’re digging into the concept of family as it pertains to our pups.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Do dogs recognize their own canine family members?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTechnically, yes. Research shows that dogs exhibit recognition for both their littermates and biological mothers. In one study, 5-week-old puppies were released into a room with wire enclosures on either side. One side housed the puppies’ mothers and littermates, while the other housed random puppies and adult female dogs. In both instances, the puppies were significantly more likely to walk over to the side of the room with their relatives than the side with strangers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nResearchers hypothesized that these results were based on scent cues, and went on to successfully test this theory by repeating the study using towels with each dog’s scent instead of the dogs themselves. The results were nearly identical. Taking it one step further, they repeated the study with 2-year-old-dogs who hadn’t seen their mothers since they were 8 weeks old to see if recognition stood the test of time. Both mothers and puppies recognized each other more than 75% of the time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese findings may seem heartwarming, but recognition doesn’t necessarily mean that dogs miss or yearn for their relatives when they’re apart. Rather, these studies prove more about the link between recognition and scent cues than an awareness of familial bonds. So yes, dogs recognize their canine relatives. But do they feel the same kind of love for their mothers that we feel for them?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do dogs relate to their human families?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere’s actually an encouraging difference between the way dogs recognize familiar dogs and  familiar humans. Scent still drives this type of recognition, but dogs don’t just see humans as another member of their pack.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn one study, a reward response was evoked in the brains of dogs who recognized the scent of a familiar human. This is a completely different response than the one triggered by recognizing another dog. (See: the way your dog acts on the sidewalk, pulling you in the direction of random dogs, while remaining disinterested in passing humans.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn other words, dogs know that humans aren’t<em> </em>like them, but they reserve a special part of their brains for the love and companionship we can provide. They’re not about to flash those <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/puppy-dog-eyes-feel-guilt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puppy eyes</a> at another dog, because they know dogs can’t provide kisses, belly rubs, or bowls of <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delicious food.</a> They love their caretakers because we help them meet fundamental needs they can’t satisfy on their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo this Thanksgiving, while you’re relishing the smell of home (aka butter) with your family, remember: your pup is also forming scent memories. They just have less to do with turkey and more to do with loving you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gralizzybear/">@gralizzybear</a></em>', 'What family really means to your dog', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'what-family-really-means-to-your-dog-4', '', '', '2018-04-09 11:50:45', '2018-04-09 11:50:45', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=74', 0, 'post', '', 0),

I majored in English.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDon’t believe me? Over the next few months we’ll be interviewing people from a variety of cities and industries about how bringing their working dogs to the office has impacted their lives, careers, and mental health. But first, a word from science.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Benefits of dogs in the workplace:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dogs make everything better. Even Excel spreadsheets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2. Happier employees = more productive employees.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3. Having a dog-friendly workplace creates a welcoming and warm energy, which can help with team building and recruiting. Allowing employees to bring their dogs to work also cuts the potential cost of dog walkers and daycare from their budgets, enabling them to save money five days a week.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n4. On a similar note, letting employees bring dogs to work removes the stress of tight time constraints — there’s less pressure to run home to feed or walk the dog at the end of the day. One 2008 survey of both small and big companies showed that dog-friendly offices had employees who were willing to work longer hours as well as lower rates of employee absenteeism. Employees working alongside their dogs are more inclined to stick around, finish work without feeling rushed, and go home when they’re ready.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n5. Like I said before, this is all backed by #science. <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/study-office-dogs-reduce-work-related-stress.html">A 2012 study</a> from Virginia Commonwealth University found that employees surrounded by dogs in the workplace were less stressed than those who left their pets at home. Randolph Barker, a leader on <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/17538351211215366">the VCU study</a> published in the International Journal of Workplace Health Management, described the outcome as a “low cost wellness benefit.” (I’m nailing economic theory right now.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n6. In the same study, researchers found that employees with in-office dogs reported higher productivity. Both of these benefits might be attributed to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone that decreases stress in the human body. Oxytocin, also known as the “cuddle hormone,” is released when bonding socially, snuggling, or petting and interacting with animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n7. Dogs foster a more collaborative work environment. Who needs a water cooler when you can gather ‘round a dog? Meet your cute new co-worker over a petting sesh. Everyone bonds over belly rubs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n8. Walking, feeding, or playing with a dog is a nice way to <a href="https://www.inc.com/jordan-smith/companies-find-stress-reducing-benefits-of-office-dogs.html">break up your work day</a>. We already know that sitting at a desk for nine hours isn’t great for your health. Taking a walk around the block (or even just to the treats jar at the front of the office) with your pup is an incentive to get moving in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHave a working dog who makes office life better?

Therapy dogs go a step even further, as they can help improve a host of mental and physical ailments. Here is a closer look at what therapy dogs do, the science behind their efficacy, and the steps you can take to get <em>your</em> pup certified.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What is a therapy dog?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor starters, a therapy dog is not the same thing as a service dog (it’s also not a dog with a prescription pad and PhD). A service dog is trained to provide assistance to someone with a specific disability such as blindness, epilepsy, or PTSD. This is essentially a full-time job for that dog, as his owner is usually the person for whom he provides this particular service.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA therapy dog needs training as well, but it tends to be more generalized and temperament-centric than, say, the very specific way a service dog is trained to protect his owner’s head during a seizure. Therapy dogs visit hospitals, assisted living facilities, college campuses, and even prisons, and provide love, comfort, and companionship.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou know when you’ve had a bad day at work so you walk by the pet store on your way home and spend 30 minutes watching puppies playing in the window? It’s a lot like that, on a more institutional level.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What is the science behind therapy dogs?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn addition to their winning combination of loyalty and fluffiness, dogs have been scientifically shown to make <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/5-ways-your-dog-is-making-you-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans healthier.</a> Therapy dogs in particular are proven to:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Reduce blood pressure\r\n</strong>High blood pressure (or hypertension) is a major risk for heart disease and stroke, so reduced blood pressure is tremendously important. Patients in assisted living facilities or hospitals may see lower blood pressure levels after spending extended periods of time petting a dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Increase both endorphins and oxytocin\r\n</strong>Endorphins are essentially a naturally occurring form of morphine, inducing a little jolt of euphoria when activated (think: the high you feel after going on a long run). Oxytocin is also a very powerful hormone – often called “the love hormone” – and gets triggered when you hug or kiss a loved one (or see a friendly tail wagging your way). It’s also believed to be the chemical backbone that underlies the feeling of trust.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Lower cortisol levels\r\n</strong>Cortisol is a steroid hormone released in response to stress, and it mostly works to increase blood sugar and assist in the metabolism of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Things like massage therapy and laughter <em>lower</em> cortisol levels, while caffeine, sleep deprivation, and severe trauma <em>increase</em> them. Which category would you rather fall into?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOf course, not <em>every</em> dog has the temperament to be a therapy dog. My own dog, for example, has such an <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense fear of strangers</a> that most interactions lead to skyrocketing blood pressures for all parties involved. This, among other reasons, is why he won’t be signing up for therapy duty anytime soon. Think your dog has what it takes?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How can my pup become a therapy dog?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you’re thinking about turning your dog into a charitable super hero, he’ll need to exhibit a few prerequisites. Is your dog naturally calm and friendly around strangers? Do crowds, loud noises, and sudden movements give him anxiety? Has he received (and excelled in) at least basic obedience training?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf the answer to all of the above is yes, then congratulations! You’re on your way to becoming a dynamic therapy duo (you, as the handler, are an important part of this equation too). To become a licensed therapy dog, you and your pup will need to pass a test and get certified by an official registry. Though the specifics of the test will vary between registries, most tests gauge your dog’s ability to sit, stay, walk through a crowd, and respond to other commands.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce you’re registered and ready to go, you can ask your registry for a list or simply reach out to hospitals, nursing homes, or any other group you feel could benefit from quality time with your newly anointed therapy dog. The world is your oyster; some therapy dogs even visit children’s libraries and sit with kids who are learning to read. Your dog’s patient, nonjudgmental gaze can help a child develop the confidence he or she will need to continue improving those reading skills.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou might not be able to heal the world, but your dog’s love and companionship can help brighten it. And if nothing else, it will give him a reason to work for those treats.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gralizzybear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@gralizzybear</a> </em>', 'How your therapy dog can change someone’s life', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-your-therapy-dog-can-change-someones-life-4', '', '', '2018-04-09 11:48:14', '2018-04-09 11:48:14', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=78', 0, 'post', '', 0),

They spend the rest of their days sprawled out on our wooden floors in a way that honestly makes them look pretty dead.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut there’s a big difference between dogs who enjoy snoozing in a patch of sunlight after a long day of sprints and ones who are consistently lethargic. Not sure which camp your dog lies in? Let’s take a look.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Signs of lethargy</em> in dogs include napping way more than usual and a diminished interest in eating or drinking. Lethargic dogs can also have delayed responses to external stimuli, like someone calling their name or tossing them a tennis ball. In other words, dogs get dazed and confused, too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour dog might be lethargic after a particularly long day and can perk back up in as little as 24 hours, but if you notice signs of lethargy for days at a time, you might want to consider other causes. Like in humans, lethargy in dogs can be caused by both physical and mental issues like <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/causes-of-dog-diarrhea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diarrhea</a>, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>, and infection, as well as <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> and depression. When coupled with any of these ailments, lethargy is a sign that it’s time to see the vet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are at-home ways to improve your dog’s energy levels, too. An <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improperly balanced</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly processed</a> diet can lead to the same sluggish feelings of lethargy you experience after eating pasta for three days straight. Consider adding fresh foods like  <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vegetables </a>(or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/sardines-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sardines</a> if you’re feeling creative) to your dog’s bowl for a boost of nutrients and energy.

In addition to the emotional distress that Halloween can cause, that bowl of candy by the front door is also treacherous for any pet. Keep your dog away from these tricks in the treat bucket this Halloween.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Chocolate</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhether or not you have kids, chocolate is bound to make its way into your house this Halloween. Most dog owners are already aware of the dangers of chocolate for dogs, but here’s a quick refresher. The villain is a molecule found in chocolate known as <em>theobromine,</em> which is very difficult for dogs to digest. Not all chocolate is equally poisonous; dark chocolate contains more than six times the amount of the deadly molecule than milk chocolate, which means those Kit Kat Halloween Darkness candies are especially spooky. Smaller dogs are at a greater risk of getting sick than bigger breeds, and symptoms include vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, and increased heart rate. If ingested in large quantities, this sinister treat can lead to death, so keep that candy bowl far out of reach.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Garlic</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGarlic is a key weapon in the fight against vampires, but it can also have adverse effects on your dog’s health. Garlic contains thiosulfate which damages red blood cells and can cause anemia. This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Raisins</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Candy</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach. Instead of chocolate or candy, chop up some <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh treats</a> for your dog to enjoy, like apples or carrots. They may not be as decadent as your treats, but your dog’s health is a far better investment. Someone needs to be around to keep you safe during those scary movies.\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/">@butterandwilson</a></em>', 'Keep your dog safe from these tricks in halloween treats', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'keep-your-dog-safe-from-these-tricks-in-halloween-treats-3', '', '', '2018-04-09 10:24:41', '2018-04-09 10:24:41', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=82', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\r\n<h5><strong>Why do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. teeth, nails, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>Grooming by coat type</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog? Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome dogs also have an undercoat, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How does your dog’s diet affect coat health?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair. The important ones here are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (both of which you can find in superfoods like olive oil!). Omega-3s help to reduce general inflammation, which can cut down on dander and combat any bites or allergies, while omega-6s stimulate hair growth. A healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids ultimately results in a strong and lustrous coat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you think your dog might have an omega-3 or omega-6 deficiency, you can supplement his diet with fish or flaxseed oil or switch to a fresh, balanced meal plan. If you’re home cooking for your dog or supplementing yourself, check in with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure that you’re feeding a balanced diet. Brushing, bathing, and feeding your dog right? Get ready for hair so healthy, it shines.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nImage: @thedogphotobooth', 'How to keep your dog’s skin and coat healthy', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-to-keep-your-dogs-skin-and-coat-healthy-3', '', '', '2018-04-09 10:15:25', '2018-04-09 10:15:25', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=84', 0, 'post', '', 0),

There are times, however, when something goes awry and your dog’s digestive system stops working as smoothly as it should.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nConstipation is a condition characterized by difficult, infrequent, or completely absent bowel movements. Dogs are normally very regular, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/decoding-your-dogs-poop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">producing stools</a> once or twice a day, but they are just as prone to digestive difficulties as humans. Here is what you need to know about constipation in your<em> </em>dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What Causes Constipation in Dogs?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nConstipation is one of the most common digestive problems seen in dogs and is typically easy to diagnose. Some of the most common symptoms of constipation include:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Forceful but ineffective attempts to defecate\r\n2. Small, hard, or dry stools Redness or swelling around the anus\r\n3. Discharge from the anus after defecating\r\n4. Loss of appetite and/or weight loss\r\n5. Lethargy or depression\r\n6. Pain when defecating\r\n7. Scooting the bottom on the floor\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog hasn’t had a bowel movement in more than a day or two, it is a sure sign of constipation. But what exactly leads to constipation?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of causes ranging from inadequate fiber content in your dog’s diet to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/save-your-dog-from-summertime-sadness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>. Constipation can also be caused by an enlarged prostate gland, excessive self-grooming, injury or trauma to the pelvis, and various neurological disorders. It can also be a side effect of certain medications or the result of an intestinal blockage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What Can You Do About It?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMild cases of constipation in dogs typically resolve themselves with time, but more severe cases may require intervention. If your dog has only been constipated for a day or two, something as simple as stirring a little canned pumpkin (the human-grade variety is perfect!) into his food can provide a boost of fiber that might get things moving again. Increasing your dog’s <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water intake </a>or switching to <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fresh food diet </a>with natural moisture can help as well.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf neither of these relieve your dog’s constipation, you may want to talk to your veterinarian about a stool softener, laxative, or other medication to help get your dog’s digestion back on track. In some cases, an enema might become necessary to evacuate the bowel, but this is definitely not something you should try at home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How Do You Prevent Constipation?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOlder dogs are more likely to develop constipation because their bowel activity naturally decreases with age. If your dog doesn’t drink a lot of water, he is also at risk for developing constipation. So, how do you prevent your dog from becoming constipated?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe best thing you can do is feed your pup a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy, high-quality diet</a> that includes fresh, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real food</a>. Make sure your dog’s diet has plenty of protein and healthy fats as well as digestible carbohydrates for dietary fiber. You may also want to consider supplementing with <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/does-your-dog-need-probiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probiotics</a> to help ensure healthy and regular digestion.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough constipation is usually a short-lived problem that resolves itself with time, chronic or prolonged constipation is not something you should ignore. If your dog exhibits severe signs of digestive distress or discomfort, take that tummy to the vet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/trinity.approved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@trinity.approved</a></em>', 'What you should know about your dog’s constipation', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'what-you-should-know-about-your-dogs-constipation-2', '', '', '2018-04-09 10:13:40', '2018-04-09 10:13:40', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=86', 0, 'post', '', 0),

They spend the rest of their days sprawled out on our wooden floors in a way that honestly makes them look pretty dead.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut there’s a big difference between dogs who enjoy snoozing in a patch of sunlight after a long day of sprints and ones who are consistently lethargic. Not sure which camp your dog lies in? Let’s take a look.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Signs of lethargy</em> in dogs include napping way more than usual and a diminished interest in eating or drinking. Lethargic dogs can also have delayed responses to external stimuli, like someone calling their name or tossing them a tennis ball. In other words, dogs get dazed and confused, too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour dog might be lethargic after a particularly long day and can perk back up in as little as 24 hours, but if you notice signs of lethargy for days at a time, you might want to consider other causes. Like in humans, lethargy in dogs can be caused by both physical and mental issues like <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/causes-of-dog-diarrhea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diarrhea</a>, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>, and infection, as well as <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> and depression. When coupled with any of these ailments, lethargy is a sign that it’s time to see the vet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are at-home ways to improve your dog’s energy levels, too. An <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improperly balanced</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly processed</a> diet can lead to the same sluggish feelings of lethargy you experience after eating pasta for three days straight. Consider adding fresh foods like  <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vegetables </a>(or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/sardines-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sardines</a> if you’re feeling creative) to your dog’s bowl for a boost of nutrients and energy. Research shows that fresh food can help build strong immunity and increase vitality in dogs, so you can also switch your pup to a regular diet of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real, unprocessed food</a> to kick that 3pm slump for good.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA Saturday in bed is necessary every once in a while, but we all know fitness is in and the same goes for your dog.

Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\r\n<h5><strong>Why do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. teeth, nails, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>Grooming by coat type</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog? Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome dogs also have an undercoat, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How does your dog’s diet affect coat health?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair. The important ones here are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (both of which you can find in superfoods like olive oil!). Omega-3s help to reduce general inflammation, which can cut down on dander and combat any bites or allergies, while omega-6s stimulate hair growth. A healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids ultimately results in a strong and lustrous coat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you think your dog might have an omega-3 or omega-6 deficiency, you can supplement his diet with fish or flaxseed oil or switch to a fresh, balanced meal plan. If you’re home cooking for your dog or supplementing yourself, check in with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure that you’re feeding a balanced diet. Brushing, bathing, and feeding your dog right? Get ready for hair so healthy, it shines.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nImage: @thedogphotobooth', 'How to keep your dog’s skin and coat healthy', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-to-keep-your-dogs-skin-and-coat-healthy-4', '', '', '2018-04-09 10:07:28', '2018-04-09 10:07:28', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=92', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(94, 1, '2018-03-29 07:25:41', '2018-03-29 07:25:41', 'Halloween can be a stressful holiday for pet owners, with the doorbell sending most dogs into a tailspin as trick or treaters arrive en masse. In addition to the emotional distress that Halloween can cause, that bowl of candy by the front door is also treacherous for any pet. Keep your dog away from these tricks in the treat bucket this Halloween.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Chocolate</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhether or not you have kids, chocolate is bound to make its way into your house this Halloween. Most dog owners are already aware of the dangers of chocolate for dogs, but here’s a quick refresher. The villain is a molecule found in chocolate known as <em>theobromine,</em> which is very difficult for dogs to digest. Not all chocolate is equally poisonous; dark chocolate contains more than six times the amount of the deadly molecule than milk chocolate, which means those Kit Kat Halloween Darkness candies are especially spooky. Smaller dogs are at a greater risk of getting sick than bigger breeds, and symptoms include vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, and increased heart rate. If ingested in large quantities, this sinister treat can lead to death, so keep that candy bowl far out of reach.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Garlic</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGarlic is a key weapon in the fight against vampires, but it can also have adverse effects on your dog’s health. Garlic contains thiosulfate which damages red blood cells and can cause anemia. This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Raisins</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Candy</h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach. Instead of chocolate or candy, chop up some <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh treats</a> for your dog to enjoy, like apples or carrots. They may not be as decadent as your treats, but your dog’s health is a far better investment. Someone needs to be around to keep you safe during those scary movies.\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/">@butterandwilson</a></em>', 'Keep your dog safe from these tricks in halloween treats', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'keep-your-dog-safe-from-these-tricks-in-halloween-treats-4', '', '', '2018-04-09 10:23:51', '2018-04-09 10:23:51', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=94', 0, 'post', '', 0),

We know to monitor our sodium intake, avoid carrageenan and high fructose corn syrup, and understand that even organic, all-natural potato chips are still chips.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPet food products, however, remain a mystery. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet food marketing</a> aims to paint a picture of health (think: images of farms and fresh vegetables on a shelf-stable bag of brown kibble), and every company promises to be the best option for your dog. It’s tempting to throw in the towel on label vigilance in the pet food aisle and blindly believe the bags, but understanding your dog’s food labels is just as important as carefully examining your own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStep one: learn to recognize the food label tricks that most pet companies are using.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>First ingredient</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust because an ingredient is listed first on a label, doesn’t mean it’s the most potent in the product. Pet food companies know that most consumers are searching for a real meat source in that prized first ingredient slot. It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Natural</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible. Stick to foods you can see and the whole feeding process becomes a lot less tricky.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenikrauze/">@jenikrauze</a></em>', 'The 11 Dog Food Label Tricks Every Owner Needs to Know', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-11-dog-food-label-tricks-every-owner-needs-to-know', '', '', '2018-04-09 12:31:13', '2018-04-09 12:31:13', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=145', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Used both as garnish and an ingredient, parsley comes in several different varieties. Flat-leaf parsley, also known as Italian parsley, has large, flat leaves and adds robust flavors in cooking (think soups, stews, and sauces) while curly parsley is primarily used for decoration. But it’s more than just a pretty face.\r\nThe Stats:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPer tablespoon of chopped herb, parsley contains just 1 calorie and no fat or cholesterol. It contains less than 1 gram of carbohydrates, fiber, and protein but it is fairly rich in Vitamins A, C, and K as well as trace minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Parsley also boasts several volatile oils which have natural anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their antimicrobial and carminative benefits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to parsley for dogs, you should only feed the curly variety. Watch those serving sizes, as parsley does contain a toxic compound called furanocoumarin which can be dangerous in excessive amounts. In smaller servings, however, parsley does your dog more good than harm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Benefits:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Freshens bad breath thanks to microbial properties\r\n2. Rich in antioxidants that protect against free-radical damage\r\n3. Relieves swelling and pain from arthritis and other inflammatory conditions\r\n4. Vitamin K content improves blood clotting and boosts liver health\r\n5. Helps soothe upset stomach and digestive problems\r\n6. Diuretic properties help prevent urinary tract infections\r\n7. Immune system support via Vitamin C\r\n8. Helps flush toxins from the body, supporting kidney health\r\n9. Vitamin A content supports vision and eye health\r\n10. Can slow the rate of growth for tumors and certain cancers\r\nHow to Feed It:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWondering how to incorporate parsley into your dog’s diet? He may not chomp down on a fresh bunch right off the bat, but adding a little to his regular food a few times a week should do the trick. If you’re concerned about accidentally giving your dog too much parsley, play it safe by blending with water (1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight) and creating a juice you can pour right into your his water bowl. You can also brew parsley root into a tea (1 teaspoon per 10 pounds of bodyweight), or bake some into homemade dog treats.

Probiotics are good microbes (either bacteria or yeasts) that live in the digestive tract and help fight off the growth and activity of bad bacteria like E. coli and salmonella.

Fresh mint is rich in Vitamins A and C which support healthy bones, skin, and vision as well as immunity\r\n2. It’s full of trace minerals like calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, folate, potassium, and zinc which all play a key role in balanced nutrition\r\n3. Mint leaves are a natural source of dietary fiber which can promote healthy digestion\r\n4. The antioxidant benefits of fresh mint protect against free-radical damage and oxidation in the cells\r\n5. Soothes upset stomach and relieves nausea or diarrhea\r\n6. Contains <em>rosmarinic acid</em> which has been shown to relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergies…\r\n7.  …and <em>menthol</em>, a natural decongestant which can help break up mucus and phlegm, relieving respiratory ailments\r\n8. Relieves symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease and reduces gas\r\n9. The leaves of the plant in particular may help reduce side effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatments\r\n10. Mint has natural antiviral, antimicrobial, antibacterial, and antifungal benefits which can all help <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/wikipup-canine-dental-hygiene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freshen your dog’s breath</a>\r\n<h4><strong>How to Feed It:</strong></h4>\r\nThe easiest way to add mint to your dog’s diet is to sprinkle a little fresh or dried mint over his food. Just don’t overdo it – a few leaves a day is about all your dog should be getting.\r\n<h4><strong>What to Watch For:</strong></h4>\r\nWhile fresh mint can be good for your dog’s health, artificial forms are another story. Breath mints, for example, often contain xylitol, an artificial sweetener that can be <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic for dogs</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you want to give your dog a mint-flavored treat, try your hand at <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/natural-remedies-for-dogs-with-bad-breath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homemade biscuits </a>with a few easy ingredients.

It’s had supporting roles in Thanksgiving stuffings and frequently stars alongside rosemary and thyme in various poultry recipes. But how much do you know about the benefits of sage for dogs?\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\nSage comes in different forms that have both medicinal and culinary applications. Garden sage (<i>Salvia officinalis</i>) is the most common variety, known for its soft, silvery green leaves. Pineapple sage (<i>Salvia elegans</i>) is highly attractive to hummingbirds and is used more for its medicinal benefits than for its flavor. Both golden sage and purple sage are grown ornamentally and for culinary application, while Berggarten sage produces particularly large, aromatic leaves. In addition to having a wonderful flavor and aroma, sage offers natural antiseptic, antibacterial, antimicrobial, and astringent properties.\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n1.  Contains Vitamins A, E, and K which support bone, skin, and eye health in addition to promoting healthy immunity\r\n2. Loaded with trace minerals like calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and zinc to support balanced nutrition\r\n3. The astringent properties of sage reduce redness and inflammation to heal skin infections\r\n4. Sage leaves can be used to ease gas or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/every-pet-owner-needs-know-bloat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bloating</a> and to treat gastrointestinal tract infections\r\n5. The leaves of the sage plant contain <em>rosmarinic acid</em> which may reduce the symptoms of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/remedies-for-your-dogs-allergies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seasonal allergies</a>\r\n6. Antioxidant properties which may help to protect against oxidation in the cells and reduce free-radical damage\r\n7. Antimicrobial properties naturally kill harmful pathogens that could cause infection\r\n8. Oils in the plant contain <em>ketones, </em>which can improve mental clarity and protect against cognitive decline\r\n9. Contains dietary fiber which may support healthy digestion and relieve constipation or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/causes-of-dog-diarrhea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diarrhea</a>\r\n10. Natural anti-inflammatory benefits may help relieve arthritis <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-signs-dog-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain</a> and other inflammatory conditions\r\n<h4>How to Feed It:</h4>\r\nThe easiest way to include sage in your dog’s diet is to mix fresh or dried leaves into his food. You can also boil dried sage leaves and Epsom salts in water to create a topical application to heal skin infections. As with many other superfood herbs, you can also bake sage into homemade dog treats.\r\n<h4>What to Watch For:</h4>\r\nUnlike some herbs which can cause digestive upset in large doses, sage is recognized by the ASPCA as being non-toxic for dogs. You should still limit your dog’s intake to a few leaves a day, but there’s no <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">danger of poisoning</a>.\r\n\r\nDo you have any helpful tips for growing sage?

It’s been used in cooking for thousands of years and is primarily comprised of monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, and antioxidants. It contains about 120 calories per tablespoon and 14 grams of fat (the good kind!).\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n1. Monounsaturated fatty acids support fat breakdown in the cells, helping to shed stored fat\r\n2. Antioxidant content protects against free-radical damage and oxidation to increase lifespan\r\n3. Natural anti-inflammatory properties help reduce the risk for serious diseases like cancer, heart\r\ndisease, and diabetes\r\n4. Supports healthy brain function and helps to prevent cognitive decline, especially in older dogs\r\n5. Oleic acid content works with other beneficial compounds to protect against cancer\r\n6. Healthy monounsaturated fatty acids support heart health by reducing cholesterol\r\n7. Helps to increase blood flow for improved heart health and general health\r\n8. Reduces effects of asthma and supports respiratory health (particularly for brachycephalic breeds)\r\n9. Improves coat condition and moisturizes dry and flaky skin\r\n10. Makes food more palatable and attractive to dogs, especially for picky eaters\r\n<h4>How to Feed It:</h4>\r\nThe simplest way to incorporate olive oil into your dog’s diet is to drizzle it over his food or use it as an ingredient in homemade dog treats. Just don’t serve your dog salad that’s been slathered in dressing. Servings should be limited to one teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight per day.\r\n<h4>What to Watch For:</h4>\r\nBe careful with what kind of olive oil you choose and how much you feed your pup. Stick to extra virgin olive oil, since it has a lower acid content than other olive oils. Always store your EVOO in a dark colored bottle away from heat sources to prevent it from going bad quickly.\r\n\r\nBone-appetit!\r\n\r\n<em>Image: </em><em><a href="https://food52.com/">Food52</a> </em>', 'Superfoods in Your Kitchen: Olive Oil for Dogs', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'superfoods-in-your-kitchen-olive-oil-for-dogs', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:49:08', '2018-04-09 09:49:08', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=167', 0, 'post', '', 0),

It’s a good time to review the most <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/">dangerous foods for your dog</a> (toxic ingredients like onion and garlic are often hidden in dishes like soups and stews), but contrary to popular belief, not all table food is bad for our dogs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo where does this myth come from?<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/"> Marketing, for starters</a>. After the invention of processed dog food, manufacturers were still struggling to successfully convince pet owners to replace real food with new, commercial varieties. So in the mid 1960s, the pet food industry launched a marketing campaign imploring consumers to “Ban All Table Scraps” from their pets’ bowls and switch to dry kibble. It worked, and we’ve been scared to give our dogs human food ever since. While the kibble guys were right in that you don’t want to train your dog to beg at the table or feed those garlic potatoes you just fried up, most people are starting to understand that a fresh food diet is a much healthier option for dogs. What some pet owners may not know is that even feeding the right table scraps can also be healthful and beneficial.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><b>How</b><b> do I know what “real” foods I can feed my dog?</b></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAvoid anything fried or cooked with additives and stick with <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/">whole, fresh foods</a> like meat, vegetables, and fruit. These are best in their natural states or lightly cooked, and are not only safe for your dogs, but also beneficial for their health. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/">Fresh food is also easier for your pup to digest</a> than processed dog food and can lead to better breath, a shinier coat, and a trimmer waistline. How many brown balls of kibble can promise that?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRemember, a few pieces of fresh turkey or broccoli in your dog’s bowl can be an amazing snack, but doesn’t count as a regular, balanced meal. If you want to experience the benefits of switching your dog over to an all-fresh diet, make sure you’re feeding<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/"> nutritionally balanced recipes</a> that have been formulated by a veterinary nutritionist.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><b>Any specific table scraps I should avoid?</b></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhile certain table foods are safe to share with your dog, you should keep the pizza and French Fries for your own cheat days. Everyone knows about chocolate, but here’s a quick recap of the table scraps that still deserve their bad rep.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Fried foods or dishes with added salt and spices\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Most Americans cook with copious amounts of butter and oil, making many holiday dishes a potential nutritional land mine for dogs (and humans)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Garlic and onion (they contain <i>allium</i>, which can damage your dog’s red blood cells and even cause them to burst)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Grapes and raisins (the exact toxin in this fruit family hasn’t been pinpointed, but grapes are high on the No Fly List for your dog’s bowl)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Packaged foods (artificial sweeteners like <em>x</em><em>ylitol</em> can sneak into packaged desserts, candies, and condiments and are some of the most dangerous ingredients for dogs)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Peaches and avocados (peach pits are poisonous, to say nothing of their danger as a choking hazard, while avocados contain a toxin called <i>persin</i>)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Tomato plants (a ripe tomato is fine, but a green tomato or any part of the plant itself can be toxic)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Cooked bones (chicken bones, we’re looking at you)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Raw potatoes (cooked is safe, but skip the buttery mashed variety)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhile your pup would no doubt love a plate of macaroni and cheese this holiday, rich foods can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and even pancreatitis if consumed in high quantities. The good news is that your dog will be just as happy enjoying a plate of steamed Brussels sprouts dressed in Turkey broth. So go ahead, put some leftover superfoods in that bowl and let the dogs join in on the holiday fun this year.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ps.ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ps.ny</a></em>', 'The Truth About Table Scraps for Dogs', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-truth-about-table-scraps-for-dogs', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:48:22', '2018-04-09 09:48:22', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=174', 0, 'post', '', 0),

It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Natural</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible. Stick to foods you can see and the whole feeding process becomes a lot less tricky.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenikrauze/">@jenikrauze</a></em>', 'The 11 Dog Food Label Tricks Every Owner Needs to Know', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-11-dog-food-label-tricks-every-owner-needs-to-know-2', '', '', '2018-04-09 12:30:56', '2018-04-09 12:30:56', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=176', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Packed with dietary fiber and potassium, pumpkins are a superfood that can benefit your dog’s health (and waistline) all year.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA cup of plain pumpkin contains about 80 calories with a whopping 10 grams of dietary fiber – that’s about 1.25 grams of fiber per ounce. A serving this size also contains 1 gram of fat, 2 grams of protein, and just 5 mg of sodium.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dietary fiber and high moisture content can aid with digestion, relieve diarrhea, and prevent constipation\r\n2. Fiber acts as a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/does-your-dog-need-probiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probiotic</a>, supporting the growth and activity of helpful bacteria in your dog’s digestive tract\r\n3.

If your dog is suffering from diarrhea or constipation, try stirring a tablespoon or two of canned pumpkin into his normal food once a day to relieve symptoms. Feeling a little more culinary? Toast <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/superfoods-kitchen-pumpkin-seeds-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raw pumpkin seeds</a> at home with a drizzle of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/superfoods-kitchen-coconut-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coconut</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/olive-oil-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">olive</a> oil and serve them as a tasty treat, or grind them up and stir them into your dog’s food. You can also combine canned pumpkin with a cup of plain yogurt and freeze the mixture in ice cube trays for a refreshing, DIY treat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What to Watch For:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlways be sure to buy plain canned pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling.

Used both as garnish and an ingredient, parsley comes in several different varieties. Flat-leaf parsley, also known as Italian parsley, has large, flat leaves and adds robust flavors in cooking (think soups, stews, and sauces) while curly parsley is primarily used for decoration. But it’s more than just a pretty face.\r\nThe Stats:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPer tablespoon of chopped herb, parsley contains just 1 calorie and no fat or cholesterol. It contains less than 1 gram of carbohydrates, fiber, and protein but it is fairly rich in Vitamins A, C, and K as well as trace minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Parsley also boasts several volatile oils which have natural anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their antimicrobial and carminative benefits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to parsley for dogs, you should only feed the curly variety. Watch those serving sizes, as parsley does contain a toxic compound called furanocoumarin which can be dangerous in excessive amounts. In smaller servings, however, parsley does your dog more good than harm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Benefits:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Freshens bad breath thanks to microbial properties\r\n2. Rich in antioxidants that protect against free-radical damage\r\n3. Relieves swelling and pain from arthritis and other inflammatory conditions\r\n4. Vitamin K content improves blood clotting and boosts liver health\r\n5. Helps soothe upset stomach and digestive problems\r\n6. Diuretic properties help prevent urinary tract infections\r\n7. Immune system support via Vitamin C\r\n8. Helps flush toxins from the body, supporting kidney health\r\n9. Vitamin A content supports vision and eye health\r\n10. Can slow the rate of growth for tumors and certain cancers\r\nHow to Feed It:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWondering how to incorporate parsley into your dog’s diet? He may not chomp down on a fresh bunch right off the bat, but adding a little to his regular food a few times a week should do the trick. If you’re concerned about accidentally giving your dog too much parsley, play it safe by blending with water (1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight) and creating a juice you can pour right into your his water bowl. You can also brew parsley root into a tea (1 teaspoon per 10 pounds of bodyweight), or bake some into homemade dog treats.

And after I’ve switched her food countless times, I was so excited to try something new that didn’t involve randomly picking a new “hypo-allergenic” dog food off a shelf at the pet store.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInstead, here’s how The Farmer’s Dog works: You fill out an <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/#signup-box">online questionnaire</a> about your dog’s size, weight, activity level, protein preference (turkey, beef, or pork) etc., then you’ll get back a customized food plan that’s delivered to you every two weeks in pre-portioned packets. You keep 5 at a time in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer (you might have to clear out some of your frozen pizza stash to make room, but you’ll survive). Then you simply feed your pup one of the packets from the fridge at breakfast and one at dinner and you’re done! There’s no measuring or hassle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKai could hardly contain herself when I received the first shipment of food and now that we’re 2 weeks into her new food regimen, there’s no way she’ll settle for kibble again.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are three awesome things that happened in the first two weeks of using The Farmer’s Dog:\r\n<h4><strong>1. My Dog’s Allergies Got SO Much Better</strong></h4>\r\nHow do I know when Kai’s allergies are bad? The easiest sign is that the hair on her head gets splotchy (see photos below). Within a week of eating The Farmer’s Dog food, the area looked significantly better. She wasn’t itchy at all and the sensitive skin on her belly returned to the normal pink color, instead of reddish and irritated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd TMI alert — her poop looked better than ever. Believe me, it’s easy to tell when you have a 95-pound dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Farmer’s Dog food is shipped to you within days of being made in human-grade kitchens in New York and you won’t believe the difference in how it looks and smells compared to the stuff you’ve been feeding your dog. At this point, Kai is probably eating better than I am…\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>2. She LOVES Eating</strong></h4>\r\nKai already loved to eat, but she was next-level excited for mealtime these last few weeks. Even if she was sound asleep on the couch before dinner, all I had to do was walk to the fridge, take out a packet, and start to pour it in her bowl and she would spring into action — with a giant string of drool hanging out of her mouth as she waited. She never reacted like that to her previous kibble dinner. No way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome nights she’d even eat all of her food then return a few minutes later to her bowl and lick it again — just to make sure she hadn’t missed a piece.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>3. I Felt Good About Feeding Her</strong></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter trying out The Farmer’s Dog, I realized I was a crazy and also <strong>lazy</strong> dog mom. After so many failed attempts at finding the right food for her allergy needs, I stuck with a kibble that was fine but not great. I didn’t really think there was anything better out there. She wasn’t itchy or in pain with her old food (I’m not <em>that</em> bad), but after seeing the improvement with The Farmer’s Dog, it was very apparent that there was something soo much better for her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, let’s be honest: her new food plan is more expensive than her kibble (cost per week varies according to the size and needs of your dog, but plans start at about $29 a week), but my dog and her health are 100% worth it. I’ll eat out one fewer time a month or ditch that afternoon Starbucks and quickly find the extra money to keep my furry BFF happy and, most importantly, healthy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images:  </em><a href="http://www.livingly.com/team/Deena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deena Bustillo </a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'My Dog Has Terrible Allergies and This Meal Service Changed All That', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'my-dog-has-terrible-allergies-and-this-meal-service-changed-all-that', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:46:25', '2018-04-09 09:46:25', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=194', 0, 'post', '', 0),

An associate veterinarian at the Belle Haven Animal Medical Centre in Virginia and expert in animal health and nutrition, she is also the host and executive producer of <a href="http://www.thepetshow.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Pet Show with Dr. Katy</em></a>. Dr. Katy has been featured on the TODAY Show, Fox &amp; Friends, NPR, CNBC, The Meredith Vieira Show, and HuffPost Live, among others.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe sat down with Dr. Katy to talk about the importance of choosing the right diet for your dog, the advice she would give every aspiring vet, and why she’s dedicated her life to animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Tell us a little bit about your career path. When did you first know you wanted to be a veterinarian?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI grew up in South Louisiana and animals were always a huge part of my life. You name it, we had it — chickens, cows, even the occasional rabbit.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy dad’s best friend was a veterinarian when I was growing up, and one summer in college he told me about a job opening at a small local zoo. I was pre-med at the time, but I went and worked and a six week position turned into 13 weeks. I absolutely loved it and thought, “This is it. This is what I want to do.” I went back to school that fall and changed my major to a pre-vet track. Two years after that, I went to Louisiana State University’s School of Veterinary Medicine.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s one piece of advice you would give to someone who wants to become a vet?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think the biggest mistake people make when they go into veterinary medicine is thinking, “I don’t want to work with people; I just want to work with animals!” One of the biggest parts of our job is actually people relations. Like pediatricians, we have patients who can’t talk and can’t tell us where it hurts, and we have very concerned parents advocating for them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy biggest piece of advice for someone who wants to be a veterinarian is to take psychology, economics, and business classes. Having interpersonal communication skills and being business savvy is a big part of being a really good vet. Vets are highly intelligent people with big hearts, but most of them are also small business owners and there actually isn’t any business training in veterinary school.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce you make the decision that being a vet is what you want, dive in and study hard. It ain’t easy!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’re very vocal about the importance of nutrition for dogs. How big of an impact do you think food has on our dogs’ health and well-being?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs a mom, I’ve really delved hard into thinking about what I’m putting in my kids’ bodies. We all put so much time and interest into what we’re eating because we know it has an impact. We are what we eat, and the same thing goes for our pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf we’re feeding our pets protein that is so highly processed it’s lost all of its nutritional integrity, we’re not doing them any favors. It’s certainly cheaper in the moment, but it’s actually not cheaper in the long run when you consider that poor diet can cause diseases and health issues like diabetes down the line. If we start with good nutrition from day one, we have a heck of a better chance of our pets living long and healthy lives.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What advice do you give pet owners who are trying to choose the best food for their dog?</strong><b>\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA lot of pet health really has to do with choosing the right food for your dog. People think they’re feeding their dog really wonderful food because they’ve read a review online, or the 19-year-old restocking the shelves at the local pet store told them it was a great brand. What you really need to do is have a conversation with your vet. Your vet is going to be able to better assess your pet’s lifestyle and caloric needs and help you figure it all out.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat really impresses me so much about <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a> is that you guys are doing what I’ve been telling people to do for years. You’ve got the algorithms in place to account for lifestyle, disease, body condition, etc. and feed dogs accordingly. Pet owners need to figure out the right daily calorie count for their dogs and stick to it, remembering that treats are extra on top of that. I think one of the hardest things is for people to be honest about that. Sometimes it’s just easier not to think about it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What are some of the biggest health issues our pets are facing today? How can pet owners protect their dogs?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think the biggest epidemic we’re seeing in pets is definitely obesity. Almost 60% of American dogs are overweight or obese. That’s shocking!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe obesity issue stems from a lack of nutritional education and a lack of being able to recognize pet obesity by owners. In a study conducted by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention (APOP), pet owners were surveyed about their dogs’ weights. 100% of the dogs included in the study were considered obese, yet <em>90% of the owners</em> <em>polled</em> said their dogs were a normal weight!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPeople are completely in denial about what is and isn’t a healthy weight for their pets, but we have to start being realistic and treating pet obesity as seriously as we treat other health issues like thyroid conditions, heart disease and even cancer. We have the science to prove that pets who weigh less live longer, and we all want to give our dogs the longest, happiest lives possible. A massive part of that is nutrition. When we’re feeding our dogs good things, it translates to good health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy biggest piece of advice would be to talk with your vet and not take it personally if they tell you that your dog is overweight. Obesity is a diagnosis of a disease, not something to get offended over. They’re not saying <i>you’re</i> a bad pet owner, they’re saying your pet has a disease and it’s one you can treat and work on together as a team. If you look at it that way, you’ll have a lot more results than if you get defensive about what you’re feeding or how much exercise your dog is getting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Such important advice. Lastly, from one crazy dog lover to another, what do you think it is about dogs that makes them so special?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat I think is really cool is that in the last couple of years, even the Pope has spoken out about animals having souls. I think that’s something that we have known for years as dog owners. I know that when I look into my dog’s eyes there is a soul in there and a sentient being who loves me unconditionally, the way that I love him. It’s been validating that there have been so many books published over the last few years about how dogs touch our souls and communicate with us.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to connect with a dog, soul to soul. There are no pretenses and you don’t need makeup or your best clothes. Dogs aren’t going to judge you; they just love you. I think everyone’s goal is to find that unconditional love in life, and whether or not we find it in another human, we know our dogs love us unconditionally. Dogs give us the comfort and connection that everyone is seeking.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images: <a href="http://www.thepetshow.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katy Nelson</a></em>', 'Vets We Love: Meet Dr. Katy', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'vets-we-love-meet-dr-katy', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:45:54', '2018-04-09 09:45:54', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=196', 0, 'post', '', 0),

A former Wilhelmina model and artist, Lauren was a founding team member at <a href="https://ritual.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ritual</a>, a health tech company that’s reinventing the vitamin through simplicity and traceability. Their first product, a multivitamin for women, contains just nine vitamins and minerals, compared with more than 20 typically found in other supplements.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLauren leads Marketing and Growth at Ritual and is based out of Los Angeles with her husband and two dogs, Rocky and Apollo. We chatted with Lauren about her favorite rituals, how she thinks about nutrition for her pups, and why New Year’s Eve holds a special significance in her house.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Tell us a little bit about your dogs, Rocky and Apollo.</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOur former dog was a 14 year old lab, Rocco, and when he passed away it just felt like there was a void in our house. We had seen this litter of English Retriever puppies and fell in love with two of them. Every day for three months I kept asking my fiancé (now husband) if we could get them. We were really debating it, though, because it’s such a huge responsibility. I’m pregnant, we were planning our wedding, we both work at startups…there’s always a lot going on!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFinally, I talked to my dad about it and he told me to follow my heart and get them. I was inspired by him, so on New Year’s Eve, instead of going to this party we had tickets to, we drove to Long Beach and picked up Rocky and Apollo. We’ve never been happier! Obviously, it was the right decision and we adore them. They’re really good puppies; they understand “no,” they haven’t torn a lot up in our house, and they’re housebroken. We’ve been really lucky in that regard.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How did you choose a pet food when you first got your pups? What was your main criteria in selecting a food? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy husband and I eat healthy and are conscious of the food we put in our bodies, and we try to do the same for our dogs. I had initially thought that certain dry food brands might be a good option compared to the more mainstream ones, because it seemed like they didn’t have a lot of gross stuff in there. After doing a little bit more research, though, I learned that it was mostly marketing and that a lot of dry food is pretty much the same.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen we discovered <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, and the dogs go so crazy for it. I’ve been uploading photos and videos to my Instagram of them eating the food because it’s the funniest thing. We have these slow feeder maze bowls for them they’re ravenous all the time, and they literally go in circles in the mazes trying to eat their Farmer’s Dog food super fast. There’s always one or two chickpeas that get caught in the maze and they end up flipping over their bowls to get to them! They just love the food.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Did you notice any changes in Rocky and Apollo when you switched them to a fresh food diet?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat people notice on our dogs is that their fur is super silky. It’s gorgeous and so thick and soft! I would say an improvement in fur is one big thing. They’re very happy and super healthy all around, and I’m sure the food has a lot to do with that.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How has switching to fresh food changed the way you think about their nutrition?</b><b> </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think people should just think about it the same way they think about feeding themselves. Would you eat Lucky Charms for every meal, every day? Probably not. Our dogs are living, breathing creatures and require real nutrients. The quality of the nutrients we get from fresh foods like vegetables and meat is so much higher than it would be in processed food. I really try to apply the same principles of what I feed myself to what I feed my dogs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>In honor of your company, Ritual, tell us about your favorite rituals with Rocky and Apollo.</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThey’re always so excited to see me when I get home from work! Since I’m pregnant I’m usually really tired at the end of the day and get right in bed. They’re not supposed to come in the bed, but they’re irresistibly cute and I usually let them. My favorite daily ritual is just spending quality time with them and giving them lots of love.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/laurenahayes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Hayes </a></em>', 'This Dog Mom is Reinventing the Vitamin for Women', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'this-dog-mom-is-reinventing-the-vitamin-for-women', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:45:43', '2018-04-09 09:45:43', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=198', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Unfortunately, my stint as a pre-vet student didn’t last very long after I fainted in my dissection class, so I’ve had to find other ways to help animals.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Chicago-based animal lover spent years volunteering at shelters, and found a new way to make her mark when she created <a href="https://www.therescuerunway.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rescue Runway</a> in February 2017. The popular blog marries her love of animals and fashion by chronicling trips to local shelters and including information on both her outfits and the pictured pups in need of homes. Whenever possible, she tries to wear clothing brands that support and donate proceeds to animal organizations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHer idea has resonated with dog lovers and fashion enthusiasts alike.

I follow many fashion bloggers and love when they share pictures of their pups, and one day I had a light bulb moment. I realized my passion for clothes could be combined with my love of equally adorable dogs (and cats!) in a new kind of fashion blog. A blog that not only shows off fun outfits, but also has a purpose behind it that people can connect with.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>You do a lot of work to raise awareness about homeless pets in Chicago. What has the response from your community been like? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo say it’s been amazing would be an understatement. Since day one, people have reached out from across the city and country telling me how wonderful of a platform this is for the rescue world. I’ve been lucky to meet some pretty incredible people in Chicago who are just as passionate about adoption as I am, and everyone has been so supportive and offered advice along the way.

Hattrick and Stanley are both working on their summer bodies and were in need of a leaner diet. Luckily, <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a> provided well-balanced meals to kick-start their weight loss goals. I’m happy to report that Stanley has lost five pounds and Hattrick is down three!

People don’t often realize that you can rescue almost any kind of dog. Big, little, purebred or mutt, the perfect pup is out there waiting for you. It may take a little research, but I promise it’s worth it.

All of the artists we’re featuring in the show responded immediately to the concept and understood how it operated on multiple levels at once. Mica Scalin (my creative development consultant and partner) and I vetted their capabilities, and then we brought Rocky with us to studio visits where he could sniff out their ideas in more detail.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRocky has a curious nature that has made him a great curating partner. He developed a rapport with the artists and together we had a dialog to determine which works would be most suitable for exhibition. The process has been really fun and illuminating for us and that’s what we hope to bring to the public in this exhibition.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What approach did the artists take to creating work for dogs?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAll of the artists are excited to frame ideas from their existing practice for a new audience and have been considering dogs’ unique points of view and perception. There will be work about the emotional issues dogs face — <a href="https://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>, which is common — as well as work that speaks to dogs’ interest in certain color schemes (they can see blue, yellow and grey). Works exploring formal, conceptual, and relational issues will be executed in a variety of media from sound and sculpture to kibble and squeaky toys.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBroadly, we know that canines perceive the world in unique ways. Olfaction is essential to their understanding, the color spectrum they see is different from a human’s, and of course they live closer to the ground. They’re also fearless and willing to engage with work in a variety of different ways, like sniffing, peeing, and licking. We expect a really diverse range of interactions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThat said, we hesitate to speak too broadly for an entire species. Just like humans, individual dogs have different attractions and aversions so we are intentionally presenting works that address a variety of aesthetic and conceptual concerns. Some artists are interested in specifics of a dog’s physical perspective or perceptual abilities, while others are more concerned with emotional connections.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe look forward to learning from the show. Will hounds react differently than terriers? Dachshunds vs Dobermans? Each piece of artwork addresses canine viewers differently, so the whole show is an experiment for both the curators and the artists.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you hope visitors will take away from the exhibit?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\ndOGUMENTA offers both the chance for humans to get to know their canine friends better and also the opportunity to approach art differently themselves. Attendees will gain new insights into their companion’s personality and character. It’s an opportunity for bonding and learning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is the biggest lesson dogs have taught you about art?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGo with your gut! Being fearless in the face of art is Rocky’s greatest lesson.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: Jason Falchook</em>', 'Introducing dOGUMENTA, the First Art Show for Dogs', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'introducing-dogumenta-the-first-art-show-for-dogs', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:44:37', '2018-04-09 09:44:37', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=202', 0, 'post', '', 0),

When she isn’t collaborating with athleisure brands like Bandier or developing her own fashion line, Arielle soaks up quality time with her 1-year-old daughter, Ruby Lou. Instagram followers can’t get enough of the mother-daughter duo, and Arielle’s feed is full of candid videos of the pair sharing dance parties, watching their favorite movies, and eating home cooked meals together. We caught up with the powerhouse NYC mom about her dog, Dylan, and her favorite morning rituals with her family.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>When did you first become a dog mom? Tell us a little bit about Dylan and what makes your relationship special.</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI got Dylan 5 years ago with my boyfriend (now husband) as our first dog together. We had met another dog that we thought we wanted, but once we met Dylan we knew he was meant to be part of our family. Dylan is so special to us because he was my first “born.” He started our family, which has now grown into four along with his baby sister, Ruby.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How do you prioritize Dylan’s health in your daily routine? </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan’s health has always been very important to us and we always thought we were giving him the best. He wound up developing HGE and was in hospitals on and off, and we tried so many different brands of food. We thankfully found <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Farmer’s Dog</a> and that has been a game changer!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’re also mom to a beautiful baby girl named Ruby! How did you prepare Dylan for the transition of having a new baby in the house?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen we first had Ruby, we took her blanket from the hospital and put it in Dylan’s bed so he could get familiar with her scent. At first we were very cautious because we didn’t know how he would adjust to a new family member. Now Ruby can’t get enough of him and they are best friends! They love watching <em>The Secret Life of Pets</em> together. They do everything together.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your favorite part of being a mom?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s ALL amazing. I couldn’t be happier. But the best part is waking her up every morning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How has your view of health changed since having Ruby?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSince having Ruby, we are constantly cooking at home. We’re always trying new things to find out what Ruby likes, which has made us <em>all</em> more health conscious!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What does a typical healthy day look like for you, Dylan, and Ruby? Are there special activities that the three of you share?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan, Ruby, and I have a morning ritual! The three of us take a walk to get coffee, and if the weather is really nice we’ll walk into SoHo for breakfast. I’m also lucky enough to work from my home office, so I can be with them all the time!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="http://instagram.com/somethingnavy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@somethingnavy</a></em>', 'Customer Spotlight: Arielle Charnas', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'customer-spotlight-arielle-charnas-2', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:44:09', '2018-04-09 09:44:09', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=206', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Kai, my 95-pound Dogo Argentino “lap dog” who thinks she’s the size of a chihuahua, has just about every allergy under the sun. No wheat or grains. Absolutely no chicken. Heck, it cost me $1,000 at the dog <em>dermatologist</em> to determine she’s also allergic to the sun. So, yeah, I’m a bit crazy, especially when we’re out and a well-intentioned, dog-loving person offers Kai a treat, which is bound to make her have diarrhea for a week — and/or give her a gnarly rash.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo, you can see why I jumped at the chance to try <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, a food delivery service for our four-legged friends that features <em>real</em> food (tested on humans!), created with board-certified veterinary nutritionists, and is customized to fit individual dog’s needs. It’s great for all dogs, but especially the ones with those special dietary needs like Kai. And after I’ve switched her food countless times, I was so excited to try something new that didn’t involve randomly picking a new “hypo-allergenic” dog food off a shelf at the pet store.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInstead, here’s how The Farmer’s Dog works: You fill out an <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/#signup-box">online questionnaire</a> about your dog’s size, weight, activity level, protein preference (turkey, beef, or pork) etc., then you’ll get back a customized food plan that’s delivered to you every two weeks in pre-portioned packets. You keep 5 at a time in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer (you might have to clear out some of your frozen pizza stash to make room, but you’ll survive). Then you simply feed your pup one of the packets from the fridge at breakfast and one at dinner and you’re done! There’s no measuring or hassle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKai could hardly contain herself when I received the first shipment of food and now that we’re 2 weeks into her new food regimen, there’s no way she’ll settle for kibble again.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are three awesome things that happened in the first two weeks of using The Farmer’s Dog:\r\n<h4><strong>1. My Dog’s Allergies Got SO Much Better</strong></h4>\r\nHow do I know when Kai’s allergies are bad? The easiest sign is that the hair on her head gets splotchy (see photos below). Within a week of eating The Farmer’s Dog food, the area looked significantly better. She wasn’t itchy at all and the sensitive skin on her belly returned to the normal pink color, instead of reddish and irritated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd TMI alert — her poop looked better than ever. Believe me, it’s easy to tell when you have a 95-pound dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Farmer’s Dog food is shipped to you within days of being made in human-grade kitchens in New York and you won’t believe the difference in how it looks and smells compared to the stuff you’ve been feeding your dog. At this point, Kai is probably eating better than I am…\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>2. She LOVES Eating</strong></h4>\r\nKai already loved to eat, but she was next-level excited for mealtime these last few weeks. Even if she was sound asleep on the couch before dinner, all I had to do was walk to the fridge, take out a packet, and start to pour it in her bowl and she would spring into action — with a giant string of drool hanging out of her mouth as she waited. She never reacted like that to her previous kibble dinner. No way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome nights she’d even eat all of her food then return a few minutes later to her bowl and lick it again — just to make sure she hadn’t missed a piece.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>3. I Felt Good About Feeding Her</strong></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter trying out The Farmer’s Dog, I realized I was a crazy and also <strong>lazy</strong> dog mom. After so many failed attempts at finding the right food for her allergy needs, I stuck with a kibble that was fine but not great. I didn’t really think there was anything better out there. She wasn’t itchy or in pain with her old food (I’m not <em>that</em> bad), but after seeing the improvement with The Farmer’s Dog, it was very apparent that there was something soo much better for her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, let’s be honest: her new food plan is more expensive than her kibble (cost per week varies according to the size and needs of your dog, but plans start at about $29 a week), but my dog and her health are 100% worth it. I’ll eat out one fewer time a month or ditch that afternoon Starbucks and quickly find the extra money to keep my furry BFF happy and, most importantly, healthy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images:  </em><a href="http://www.livingly.com/team/Deena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deena Bustillo </a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'My Dog Has Terrible Allergies and This Meal Service Changed All That', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'my-dog-has-terrible-allergies-and-this-meal-service-changed-all-that-2', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:43:58', '2018-04-09 09:43:58', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=208', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(210, 1, '2018-03-30 08:15:38', '2018-03-30 08:15:38', 'There’s a common misconception that if you aren’t ready to<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-rescue-runways-guide-to-adopting-a-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> adopt a dog</a>, you can’t help a homeless pet. While adoption is one of the biggest ways to make an impact, it’s certainly not the only one. Here are a few creative ways you can get involved and make a real difference in the lives of rescue pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Foster</h5>\r\nMany people can’t commit to a permanent adoption due to busy schedules, traveling, or expenses. Holding off on adopting is a responsible decision when you know you can’t care for an animal long-term, but if you have a two or four week opening on your calendar, fostering might be for you. Plenty of local rescues need foster homes for animals, and sometimes organizations will even pay for all the expenses as long as you can provide love and shelter. It might be hard to say goodbye at the end of the foster stay, but remember that you’ve helped free up space for that organization to take in even more animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Volunteer</h5>\r\nWalk into any shelter and ask if they need help and you’ll be hard pressed to find one that will turn you down. It takes a village to run any nonprofit and when you have animals that need to be cared for, it’s that much more important to have volunteers. Whether you’re looking to help with marketing, fundraising, or simply want to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-importance-of-letting-your-dog-sniff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk dogs</a>, your skill set and time will be put to good use.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Educate</h5>\r\nSo you’re allergic to anything with four legs but still want to help in the plight to save animals. Become an educator! Often times, rescues already have some sort of program in place to educate the community about helping their local pet population. You can go to schools, religious organizations, or businesses and host a discussion on spay/neuter, how to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dangerous-items-dogs-hiding-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">care for pets</a>, and why adoption is important. Education is one of the most powerful tools in the fight against homelessness for pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Fundraise</h5>\r\nIf you like to host events or plan parties, consider organizing a fundraiser for your local shelter. It can be as simple as a bake sale or as extravagant as a gala; anything you can contribute will be an asset. Partner with a local boutique for a Shop Your Cause event, or ask your gym to host a workout fundraiser. Get creative with it and do something that you enjoy. In the end, your local shelter will appreciate whatever amount you raise.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Donate</h5>\r\nIf you’re short on time and resources, skip that latte and donate $5 to a rescue of your choice instead. If you want to make a more direct impact, many organizations have a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/hurricane-harvey-how-to-help/">wish list</a> of items they need. You can usually find these lists under the donations tab on their website, or you can reach out to them directly and ask. Whether you can gift a blanket or a month’s supply of heart worm medication, your donation will help an animal in need.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@butterandwilson</a></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Here’s How to Help Homeless Dogs Without Adopting', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'heres-how-to-help-homeless-dogs-without-adopting', '', '', '2018-04-09 12:32:33', '2018-04-09 12:32:33', '', 0, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/?p=210', 0, 'post', '', 0),

While adoption is one of the biggest ways to make an impact, it’s certainly not the only one. Here are a few creative ways you can get involved and make a real difference in the lives of rescue pets.\n<h4>Foster</h4>\nMany people can’t commit to a permanent adoption due to busy schedules, traveling, or expenses. Holding off on adopting is a responsible decision when you know you can’t care for an animal long-term, but if you have a two or four week opening on your calendar, fostering might be for you. Plenty of local rescues need foster homes for animals, and sometimes organizations will even pay for all the expenses as long as you can provide love and shelter.

While adoption is one of the biggest ways to make an impact, it’s certainly not the only one. Here are a few creative ways you can get involved and make a real difference in the lives of rescue pets.\r\n<h4>Foster</h4>\r\nMany people can’t commit to a permanent adoption due to busy schedules, traveling, or expenses. Holding off on adopting is a responsible decision when you know you can’t care for an animal long-term, but if you have a two or four week opening on your calendar, fostering might be for you. Plenty of local rescues need foster homes for animals, and sometimes organizations will even pay for all the expenses as long as you can provide love and shelter. It might be hard to say goodbye at the end of the foster stay, but remember that you’ve helped free up space for that organization to take in even more animals.\r\n<h4>Volunteer</h4>\r\nWalk into any shelter and ask if they need help and you’ll be hard pressed to find one that will turn you down. It takes a village to run any nonprofit and when you have animals that need to be cared for, it’s that much more important to have volunteers.

My Dog’s Allergies Got SO Much Better</strong></h4>\r\nHow do I know when Kai’s allergies are bad? The easiest sign is that the hair on her head gets splotchy (see photos below). Within a week of eating The Farmer’s Dog food, the area looked significantly better. She wasn’t itchy at all and the sensitive skin on her belly returned to the normal pink color, instead of reddish and irritated.\r\n\r\nAnd TMI alert — her poop looked better than ever. Believe me, it’s easy to tell when you have a 95-pound dog.\r\n\r\nThe Farmer’s Dog food is shipped to you within days of being made in human-grade kitchens in New York and you won’t believe the difference in how it looks and smells compared to the stuff you’ve been feeding your dog. At this point, Kai is probably eating better than I am…\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>2. She LOVES Eating</strong></h4>\r\nKai already loved to eat, but she was next-level excited for mealtime these last few weeks. Even if she was sound asleep on the couch before dinner, all I had to do was walk to the fridge, take out a packet, and start to pour it in her bowl and she would spring into action — with a giant string of drool hanging out of her mouth as she waited. She never reacted like that to her previous kibble dinner. No way.\r\n\r\nSome nights she’d even eat all of her food then return a few minutes later to her bowl and lick it again — just to make sure she hadn’t missed a piece.\r\n<h4><strong>3. I Felt Good About Feeding Her</strong></h4>\r\nAfter trying out The Farmer’s Dog, I realized I was a crazy and also <strong>lazy</strong> dog mom. After so many failed attempts at finding the right food for her allergy needs, I stuck with a kibble that was fine but not great. I didn’t really think there was anything better out there. She wasn’t itchy or in pain with her old food (I’m not <em>that</em> bad), but after seeing the improvement with The Farmer’s Dog, it was very apparent that there was something soo much better for her.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, let’s be honest: her new food plan is more expensive than her kibble (cost per week varies according to the size and needs of your dog, but plans start at about $29 a week), but my dog and her health are 100% worth it. I’ll eat out one fewer time a month or ditch that afternoon Starbucks and quickly find the extra money to keep my furry BFF happy and, most importantly, healthy.\r\n\r\n<em>Images:  </em><a href="http://www.livingly.com/team/Deena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deena Bustillo </a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'My Dog Has Terrible Allergies and This Meal Service Changed All That', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '208-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:23:58', '2018-04-09 08:23:58', '', 208, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/208-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

After so many failed attempts at finding the right food for her allergy needs, I stuck with a kibble that was fine but not great. I didn’t really think there was anything better out there. She wasn’t itchy or in pain with her old food (I’m not <em>that</em> bad), but after seeing the improvement with The Farmer’s Dog, it was very apparent that there was something soo much better for her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, let’s be honest: her new food plan is more expensive than her kibble (cost per week varies according to the size and needs of your dog, but plans start at about $29 a week), but my dog and her health are 100% worth it. I’ll eat out one fewer time a month or ditch that afternoon Starbucks and quickly find the extra money to keep my furry BFF happy and, most importantly, healthy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images:  </em><a href="http://www.livingly.com/team/Deena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deena Bustillo </a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'My Dog Has Terrible Allergies and This Meal Service Changed All That', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '208-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:24:56', '2018-04-09 08:24:56', '', 208, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/208-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This summer, <a href="http://www.dogumenta.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dOGUMENTA (I) NYC</a> is offering pet owners (and lovers) a new opportunity to connect and experience visual art with their dogs. We sat down with founding curator Jessica Dawson to talk about the inspiration behind the exhibit and the biggest lesson dogs can teach us about art.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What inspired the launch of dOGUMENTA?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe project was inspired by my gallery visits with my rescue dog Rocky, whose insights inspired the Dogumenta manifesto “<a href="http://www.dogumenta.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 Things My Dog Taught Me About Art</a>.” I delivered the manifesto at a gallery in Brooklyn last year and felt that it was time for canines to have an art show all their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How did you begin curating the exhibit? What kind of visual artists did you want to include?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce we found our venue partner (Brookfield Place in New York), we started hounding artists whose work we found interesting. All of the artists we’re featuring in the show responded immediately to the concept and understood how it operated on multiple levels at once. Mica Scalin (my creative development consultant and partner) and I vetted their capabilities, and then we brought Rocky with us to studio visits where he could sniff out their ideas in more detail.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRocky has a curious nature that has made him a great curating partner. He developed a rapport with the artists and together we had a dialog to determine which works would be most suitable for exhibition. The process has been really fun and illuminating for us and that’s what we hope to bring to the public in this exhibition.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What approach did the artists take to creating work for dogs?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAll of the artists are excited to frame ideas from their existing practice for a new audience and have been considering dogs’ unique points of view and perception. There will be work about the emotional issues dogs face — <a href="https://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>, which is common — as well as work that speaks to dogs’ interest in certain color schemes (they can see blue, yellow and grey). Works exploring formal, conceptual, and relational issues will be executed in a variety of media from sound and sculpture to kibble and squeaky toys.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBroadly, we know that canines perceive the world in unique ways. Olfaction is essential to their understanding, the color spectrum they see is different from a human’s, and of course they live closer to the ground. They’re also fearless and willing to engage with work in a variety of different ways, like sniffing, peeing, and licking. We expect a really diverse range of interactions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThat said, we hesitate to speak too broadly for an entire species. Just like humans, individual dogs have different attractions and aversions so we are intentionally presenting works that address a variety of aesthetic and conceptual concerns. Some artists are interested in specifics of a dog’s physical perspective or perceptual abilities, while others are more concerned with emotional connections.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe look forward to learning from the show. Will hounds react differently than terriers? Dachshunds vs Dobermans? Each piece of artwork addresses canine viewers differently, so the whole show is an experiment for both the curators and the artists.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you hope visitors will take away from the exhibit?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\ndOGUMENTA offers both the chance for humans to get to know their canine friends better and also the opportunity to approach art differently themselves. Attendees will gain new insights into their companion’s personality and character. It’s an opportunity for bonding and learning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is the biggest lesson dogs have taught you about art?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGo with your gut! Being fearless in the face of art is Rocky’s greatest lesson.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: Jason Falchook</em>', 'Introducing dOGUMENTA, the First Art Show for Dogs', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '202-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:30:16', '2018-04-09 08:30:16', '', 202, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/202-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Unfortunately, my stint as a pre-vet student didn’t last very long after I fainted in my dissection class, so I’ve had to find other ways to help animals.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Chicago-based animal lover spent years volunteering at shelters, and found a new way to make her mark when she created <a href="https://www.therescuerunway.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rescue Runway</a> in February 2017. The popular blog marries her love of animals and fashion by chronicling trips to local shelters and including information on both her outfits and the pictured pups in need of homes. Whenever possible, she tries to wear clothing brands that support and donate proceeds to animal organizations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHer idea has resonated with dog lovers and fashion enthusiasts alike. Within months of its launch, The Rescue Runway was featured in <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/pets/ct-chicago-fashion-blog-shelter-dogs-20170616-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Chicago Tribune</a> and received praise from fashion designer and blogger <a href="https://laurenconrad.com/blog/2017/07/lc-com-edit-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Conrad.</a> “I will never charge shelters for my “services,” so I am constantly looking for ways to partner with like-minded brands who are interested in making a fashionable social statement,” Christine shared with <em>the Digest. </em>“The goal is to make The Rescue Runway my full-time job within the next two years.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe caught up with Christine to talk dogs, blogs, and the biggest lesson animals have taught her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How was the idea for The Rescue Runway born? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI’ve always been an active volunteer at animal shelters in and around Chicago and wanted to find a way to promote adoption to a new audience. I follow many fashion bloggers and love when they share pictures of their pups, and one day I had a light bulb moment. I realized my passion for clothes could be combined with my love of equally adorable dogs (and cats!) in a new kind of fashion blog. A blog that not only shows off fun outfits, but also has a purpose behind it that people can connect with.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>You do a lot of work to raise awareness about homeless pets in Chicago. What has the response from your community been like? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo say it’s been amazing would be an understatement. Since day one, people have reached out from across the city and country telling me how wonderful of a platform this is for the rescue world. I’ve been lucky to meet some pretty incredible people in Chicago who are just as passionate about adoption as I am, and everyone has been so supportive and offered advice along the way. One of my new blogger friends just adopted her first pup and let me know that my blog helped her make the decision!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’ve written about your exploration of the </strong><a href="https://www.therescuerunway.com/single-post/kibbles-and-bits-of-everything" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.therescuerunway.com/single-post/kibbles-and-bits-of-everything&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1501617677812000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIECAyAK7qnfpy4E6X-AZHVlQYIQ"><strong>pet food industry</strong></a><strong> and your experience trying a fresh diet for your dogs Hattrick and Stanley. What’s your approach to feeding them these days? </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWriting that post was quite the eye-opener and it’s completely changed my approach to feeding my pets. Hattrick and Stanley are both working on their summer bodies and were in need of a leaner diet. Luckily, <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a> provided well-balanced meals to kick-start their weight loss goals. I’m happy to report that Stanley has lost five pounds and Hattrick is down three! I’m hoping to switch them to a total human-grade diet by the end of the year, and for now they’re eating a combination of The Farmer’s Dog and a zero-grain dog food to shave off a few more pounds!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is it about animals that makes them so special to you? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI will always be in awe of the unconditional and innocent love that animals possess. Some of my favorite dogs have been the ones who were treated so badly before being saved and are still the sweetest pups and have so much love to give. We can all learn a lesson from them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you hope people learn from visiting The Rescue Runway? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy blog is full of educational posts about things that are all important to me, but I hope the number one takeaway is just how amazing adopting a pet can be. People don’t often realize that you can rescue almost any kind of dog. Big, little, purebred or mutt, the perfect pup is out there waiting for you. It may take a little research, but I promise it’s worth it. I hear from followers all the time that in the end, it’s really the dog that rescues the person.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/therescuerunway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rescue Runway</a>', 'How One Fashion Blogger is Giving Shelter Dogs a Voice', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '200-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:31:40', '2018-04-09 08:31:40', '', 200, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/200-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

A former Wilhelmina model and artist, Lauren was a founding team member at <a href="https://ritual.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ritual</a>, a health tech company that’s reinventing the vitamin through simplicity and traceability. Their first product, a multivitamin for women, contains just nine vitamins and minerals, compared with more than 20 typically found in other supplements.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLauren leads Marketing and Growth at Ritual and is based out of Los Angeles with her husband and two dogs, Rocky and Apollo. We chatted with Lauren about her favorite rituals, how she thinks about nutrition for her pups, and why New Year’s Eve holds a special significance in her house.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Tell us a little bit about your dogs, Rocky and Apollo.</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur former dog was a 14 year old lab, Rocco, and when he passed away it just felt like there was a void in our house. We had seen this litter of English Retriever puppies and fell in love with two of them. Every day for three months I kept asking my fiancé (now husband) if we could get them. We were really debating it, though, because it’s such a huge responsibility. I’m pregnant, we were planning our wedding, we both work at startups…there’s always a lot going on!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFinally, I talked to my dad about it and he told me to follow my heart and get them. I was inspired by him, so on New Year’s Eve, instead of going to this party we had tickets to, we drove to Long Beach and picked up Rocky and Apollo. We’ve never been happier! Obviously, it was the right decision and we adore them. They’re really good puppies; they understand “no,” they haven’t torn a lot up in our house, and they’re housebroken. We’ve been really lucky in that regard.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>How did you choose a pet food when you first got your pups? What was your main criteria in selecting a food? </b>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy husband and I eat healthy and are conscious of the food we put in our bodies, and we try to do the same for our dogs. I had initially thought that certain dry food brands might be a good option compared to the more mainstream ones, because it seemed like they didn’t have a lot of gross stuff in there. After doing a little bit more research, though, I learned that it was mostly marketing and that a lot of dry food is pretty much the same.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen we discovered <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, and the dogs go so crazy for it. I’ve been uploading photos and videos to my Instagram of them eating the food because it’s the funniest thing. We have these slow feeder maze bowls for them they’re ravenous all the time, and they literally go in circles in the mazes trying to eat their Farmer’s Dog food super fast.

A former Wilhelmina model and artist, Lauren was a founding team member at <a href="https://ritual.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ritual</a>, a health tech company that’s reinventing the vitamin through simplicity and traceability. Their first product, a multivitamin for women, contains just nine vitamins and minerals, compared with more than 20 typically found in other supplements.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLauren leads Marketing and Growth at Ritual and is based out of Los Angeles with her husband and two dogs, Rocky and Apollo. We chatted with Lauren about her favorite rituals, how she thinks about nutrition for her pups, and why New Year’s Eve holds a special significance in her house.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Tell us a little bit about your dogs, Rocky and Apollo.</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOur former dog was a 14 year old lab, Rocco, and when he passed away it just felt like there was a void in our house. We had seen this litter of English Retriever puppies and fell in love with two of them. Every day for three months I kept asking my fiancé (now husband) if we could get them. We were really debating it, though, because it’s such a huge responsibility. I’m pregnant, we were planning our wedding, we both work at startups…there’s always a lot going on!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFinally, I talked to my dad about it and he told me to follow my heart and get them. I was inspired by him, so on New Year’s Eve, instead of going to this party we had tickets to, we drove to Long Beach and picked up Rocky and Apollo. We’ve never been happier! Obviously, it was the right decision and we adore them. They’re really good puppies; they understand “no,” they haven’t torn a lot up in our house, and they’re housebroken. We’ve been really lucky in that regard.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How did you choose a pet food when you first got your pups? What was your main criteria in selecting a food? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy husband and I eat healthy and are conscious of the food we put in our bodies, and we try to do the same for our dogs. I had initially thought that certain dry food brands might be a good option compared to the more mainstream ones, because it seemed like they didn’t have a lot of gross stuff in there. After doing a little bit more research, though, I learned that it was mostly marketing and that a lot of dry food is pretty much the same.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen we discovered <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, and the dogs go so crazy for it. I’ve been uploading photos and videos to my Instagram of them eating the food because it’s the funniest thing. We have these slow feeder maze bowls for them they’re ravenous all the time, and they literally go in circles in the mazes trying to eat their Farmer’s Dog food super fast. There’s always one or two chickpeas that get caught in the maze and they end up flipping over their bowls to get to them! They just love the food.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Did you notice any changes in Rocky and Apollo when you switched them to a fresh food diet?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat people notice on our dogs is that their fur is super silky. It’s gorgeous and so thick and soft! I would say an improvement in fur is one big thing.

Dr. Katy has been featured on the TODAY Show, Fox &amp; Friends, NPR, CNBC, The Meredith Vieira Show, and HuffPost Live, among others.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe sat down with Dr. Katy to talk about the importance of choosing the right diet for your dog, the advice she would give every aspiring vet, and why she’s dedicated her life to animals.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Tell us a little bit about your career path. When did you first know you wanted to be a veterinarian?</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI grew up in South Louisiana and animals were always a huge part of my life. You name it, we had it — chickens, cows, even the occasional rabbit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy dad’s best friend was a veterinarian when I was growing up, and one summer in college he told me about a job opening at a small local zoo. I was pre-med at the time, but I went and worked and a six week position turned into 13 weeks. I absolutely loved it and thought, “This is it. This is what I want to do.” I went back to school that fall and changed my major to a pre-vet track. Two years after that, I went to Louisiana State University’s School of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What’s one piece of advice you would give to someone who wants to become a vet?</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think the biggest mistake people make when they go into veterinary medicine is thinking, “I don’t want to work with people; I just want to work with animals!” One of the biggest parts of our job is actually people relations. Like pediatricians, we have patients who can’t talk and can’t tell us where it hurts, and we have very concerned parents advocating for them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy biggest piece of advice for someone who wants to be a veterinarian is to take psychology, economics, and business classes. Having interpersonal communication skills and being business savvy is a big part of being a really good vet. Vets are highly intelligent people with big hearts, but most of them are also small business owners and there actually isn’t any business training in veterinary school.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOnce you make the decision that being a vet is what you want, dive in and study hard. It ain’t easy!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>You’re very vocal about the importance of nutrition for dogs. How big of an impact do you think food has on our dogs’ health and well-being?</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs a mom, I’ve really delved hard into thinking about what I’m putting in my kids’ bodies. We all put so much time and interest into what we’re eating because we know it has an impact. We are what we eat, and the same thing goes for our pets.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf we’re feeding our pets protein that is so highly processed it’s lost all of its nutritional integrity, we’re not doing them any favors. It’s certainly cheaper in the moment, but it’s actually not cheaper in the long run when you consider that poor diet can cause diseases and health issues like diabetes down the line. If we start with good nutrition from day one, we have a heck of a better chance of our pets living long and healthy lives.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What advice do you give pet owners who are trying to choose the best food for their dog?</strong><b>\n</b>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA lot of pet health really has to do with choosing the right food for your dog. People think they’re feeding their dog really wonderful food because they’ve read a review online, or the 19-year-old restocking the shelves at the local pet store told them it was a great brand. What you really need to do is have a conversation with your vet. Your vet is going to be able to better assess your pet’s lifestyle and caloric needs and help you figure it all out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat really impresses me so much about <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a> is that you guys are doing what I’ve been telling people to do for years. You’ve got the algorithms in place to account for lifestyle, disease, body condition, etc. and feed dogs accordingly. Pet owners need to figure out the right daily calorie count for their dogs and stick to it, remembering that treats are extra on top of that. I think one of the hardest things is for people to be honest about that. Sometimes it’s just easier not to think about it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What are some of the biggest health issues our pets are facing today? How can pet owners protect their dogs?</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think the biggest epidemic we’re seeing in pets is definitely obesity. Almost 60% of American dogs are overweight or obese. That’s shocking!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe obesity issue stems from a lack of nutritional education and a lack of being able to recognize pet obesity by owners. In a study conducted by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention (APOP), pet owners were surveyed about their dogs’ weights. 100% of the dogs included in the study were considered obese, yet <em>90% of the owners</em> <em>polled</em> said their dogs were a normal weight!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPeople are completely in denial about what is and isn’t a healthy weight for their pets, but we have to start being realistic and treating pet obesity as seriously as we treat other health issues like thyroid conditions, heart disease and even cancer. We have the science to prove that pets who weigh less live longer, and we all want to give our dogs the longest, happiest lives possible. A massive part of that is nutrition. When we’re feeding our dogs good things, it translates to good health.\n\nMy biggest piece of advice would be to talk with your vet and not take it personally if they tell you that your dog is overweight. Obesity is a diagnosis of a disease, not something to get offended over. They’re not saying <i>you’re</i> a bad pet owner, they’re saying your pet has a disease and it’s one you can treat and work on together as a team. If you look at it that way, you’ll have a lot more results than if you get defensive about what you’re feeding or how much exercise your dog is getting.\n\n<em> </em>\n\n<strong>Such important advice. Lastly, from one crazy dog lover to another, what do you think it is about dogs that makes them so special?</strong>\n\nWhat I think is really cool is that in the last couple of years, even the Pope has spoken out about animals having souls. I think that’s something that we have known for years as dog owners. I know that when I look into my dog’s eyes there is a soul in there and a sentient being who loves me unconditionally, the way that I love him. It’s been validating that there have been so many books published over the last few years about how dogs touch our souls and communicate with us.\n\nIt’s easy to connect with a dog, soul to soul. There are no pretenses and you don’t need makeup or your best clothes. Dogs aren’t going to judge you; they just love you. I think everyone’s goal is to find that unconditional love in life, and whether or not we find it in another human, we know our dogs love us unconditionally. Dogs give us the comfort and connection that everyone is seeking.\n\n<em>Images: <a href="http://www.thepetshow.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katy Nelson</a></em>', 'Vets We Love: Meet Dr. Katy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '196-autosave-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:35:19', '2018-04-09 08:35:19', '', 196, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/196-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Kai, my 95-pound Dogo Argentino “lap dog” who thinks she’s the size of a chihuahua, has just about every allergy under the sun. No wheat or grains. Absolutely no chicken. Heck, it cost me $1,000 at the dog <em>dermatologist</em> to determine she’s also allergic to the sun. So, yeah, I’m a bit crazy, especially when we’re out and a well-intentioned, dog-loving person offers Kai a treat, which is bound to make her have diarrhea for a week — and/or give her a gnarly rash.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo, you can see why I jumped at the chance to try <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, a food delivery service for our four-legged friends that features <em>real</em> food (tested on humans!), created with board-certified veterinary nutritionists, and is customized to fit individual dog’s needs. It’s great for all dogs, but especially the ones with those special dietary needs like Kai. And after I’ve switched her food countless times, I was so excited to try something new that didn’t involve randomly picking a new “hypo-allergenic” dog food off a shelf at the pet store.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInstead, here’s how The Farmer’s Dog works: You fill out an <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/#signup-box">online questionnaire</a> about your dog’s size, weight, activity level, protein preference (turkey, beef, or pork) etc., then you’ll get back a customized food plan that’s delivered to you every two weeks in pre-portioned packets. You keep 5 at a time in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer (you might have to clear out some of your frozen pizza stash to make room, but you’ll survive). Then you simply feed your pup one of the packets from the fridge at breakfast and one at dinner and you’re done! There’s no measuring or hassle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKai could hardly contain herself when I received the first shipment of food and now that we’re 2 weeks into her new food regimen, there’s no way she’ll settle for kibble again.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are three awesome things that happened in the first two weeks of using The Farmer’s Dog:\r\n<h4><strong>1. My Dog’s Allergies Got SO Much Better</strong></h4>\r\nHow do I know when Kai’s allergies are bad? The easiest sign is that the hair on her head gets splotchy (see photos below). Within a week of eating The Farmer’s Dog food, the area looked significantly better. She wasn’t itchy at all and the sensitive skin on her belly returned to the normal pink color, instead of reddish and irritated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd TMI alert — her poop looked better than ever. Believe me, it’s easy to tell when you have a 95-pound dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Farmer’s Dog food is shipped to you within days of being made in human-grade kitchens in New York and you won’t believe the difference in how it looks and smells compared to the stuff you’ve been feeding your dog. At this point, Kai is probably eating better than I am…\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>2. She LOVES Eating</strong></h4>\r\nKai already loved to eat, but she was next-level excited for mealtime these last few weeks. Even if she was sound asleep on the couch before dinner, all I had to do was walk to the fridge, take out a packet, and start to pour it in her bowl and she would spring into action — with a giant string of drool hanging out of her mouth as she waited. She never reacted like that to her previous kibble dinner. No way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome nights she’d even eat all of her food then return a few minutes later to her bowl and lick it again — just to make sure she hadn’t missed a piece.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>3. I Felt Good About Feeding Her</strong></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter trying out The Farmer’s Dog, I realized I was a crazy and also <strong>lazy</strong> dog mom. After so many failed attempts at finding the right food for her allergy needs, I stuck with a kibble that was fine but not great. I didn’t really think there was anything better out there. She wasn’t itchy or in pain with her old food (I’m not <em>that</em> bad), but after seeing the improvement with The Farmer’s Dog, it was very apparent that there was something soo much better for her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, let’s be honest: her new food plan is more expensive than her kibble (cost per week varies according to the size and needs of your dog, but plans start at about $29 a week), but my dog and her health are 100% worth it. I’ll eat out one fewer time a month or ditch that afternoon Starbucks and quickly find the extra money to keep my furry BFF happy and, most importantly, healthy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images:  </em><a href="http://www.livingly.com/team/Deena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deena Bustillo </a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'My Dog Has Terrible Allergies and This Meal Service Changed All That', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '194-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:36:48', '2018-04-09 08:36:48', '', 194, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/194-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

When she isn’t collaborating with athleisure brands like Bandier or developing her own fashion line, Arielle soaks up quality time with her 1-year-old daughter, Ruby Lou. Instagram followers can’t get enough of the mother-daughter duo, and Arielle’s feed is full of candid videos of the pair sharing dance parties, watching their favorite movies, and eating home cooked meals together. We caught up with the powerhouse NYC mom about her dog, Dylan, and her favorite morning rituals with her family.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>When did you first become a dog mom? Tell us a little bit about Dylan and what makes your relationship special.</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI got Dylan 5 years ago with my boyfriend (now husband) as our first dog together. We had met another dog that we thought we wanted, but once we met Dylan we knew he was meant to be part of our family. Dylan is so special to us because he was my first “born.” He started our family, which has now grown into four along with his baby sister, Ruby.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How do you prioritize Dylan’s health in your daily routine? </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan’s health has always been very important to us and we always thought we were giving him the best. He wound up developing HGE and was in hospitals on and off, and we tried so many different brands of food. We thankfully found <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Farmer’s Dog</a> and that has been a game changer!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’re also mom to a beautiful baby girl named Ruby! How did you prepare Dylan for the transition of having a new baby in the house?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen we first had Ruby, we took her blanket from the hospital and put it in Dylan’s bed so he could get familiar with her scent. At first we were very cautious because we didn’t know how he would adjust to a new family member. Now Ruby can’t get enough of him and they are best friends! They love watching <em>The Secret Life of Pets</em> together. They do everything together.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your favorite part of being a mom?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s ALL amazing. I couldn’t be happier. But the best part is waking her up every morning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How has your view of health changed since having Ruby?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSince having Ruby, we are constantly cooking at home. We’re always trying new things to find out what Ruby likes, which has made us <em>all</em> more health conscious!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What does a typical healthy day look like for you, Dylan, and Ruby? Are there special activities that the three of you share?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan, Ruby, and I have a morning ritual! The three of us take a walk to get coffee, and if the weather is really nice we’ll walk into SoHo for breakfast. I’m also lucky enough to work from my home office, so I can be with them all the time!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="http://instagram.com/somethingnavy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@somethingnavy</a></em>', 'Customer Spotlight: Arielle Charnas', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '192-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:37:28', '2018-04-09 08:37:28', '', 192, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/192-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

While adoption is one of the biggest ways to make an impact, it’s certainly not the only one. Here are a few creative ways you can get involved and make a real difference in the lives of rescue pets.\r\n<h5>Foster</h5>\r\nMany people can’t commit to a permanent adoption due to busy schedules, traveling, or expenses. Holding off on adopting is a responsible decision when you know you can’t care for an animal long-term, but if you have a two or four week opening on your calendar, fostering might be for you. Plenty of local rescues need foster homes for animals, and sometimes organizations will even pay for all the expenses as long as you can provide love and shelter. It might be hard to say goodbye at the end of the foster stay, but remember that you’ve helped free up space for that organization to take in even more animals.\r\n<h5>Volunteer</h5>\r\nWalk into any shelter and ask if they need help and you’ll be hard pressed to find one that will turn you down. It takes a village to run any nonprofit and when you have animals that need to be cared for, it’s that much more important to have volunteers. Whether you’re looking to help with marketing, fundraising, or simply want to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-importance-of-letting-your-dog-sniff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk dogs</a>, your skill set and time will be put to good use.\r\n<h5>Educate</h5>\r\nSo you’re allergic to anything with four legs but still want to help in the plight to save animals. Become an educator! Often times, rescues already have some sort of program in place to educate the community about helping their local pet population. You can go to schools, religious organizations, or businesses and host a discussion on spay/neuter, how to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dangerous-items-dogs-hiding-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">care for pets</a>, and why adoption is important. Education is one of the most powerful tools in the fight against homelessness for pets.\r\n<h5>Fundraise</h5>\r\nIf you like to host events or plan parties, consider organizing a fundraiser for your local shelter. It can be as simple as a bake sale or as extravagant as a gala; anything you can contribute will be an asset. Partner with a local boutique for a Shop Your Cause event, or ask your gym to host a workout fundraiser. Get creative with it and do something that you enjoy. In the end, your local shelter will appreciate whatever amount you raise.\r\n<h5>Donate</h5>\r\nIf you’re short on time and resources, skip that latte and donate $5 to a rescue of your choice instead. If you want to make a more direct impact, many organizations have a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/hurricane-harvey-how-to-help/">wish list</a> of items they need. You can usually find these lists under the donations tab on their website, or you can reach out to them directly and ask. Whether you can gift a blanket or a month’s supply of heart worm medication, your donation will help an animal in need.\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@butterandwilson</a></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Here’s How to Help Homeless Dogs Without Adopting', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '210-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:46:14', '2018-04-09 08:46:14', '', 210, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/210-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Packed with dietary fiber and potassium, pumpkins are a superfood that can benefit your dog’s health (and waistline) all year.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA cup of plain pumpkin contains about 80 calories with a whopping 10 grams of dietary fiber – that’s about 1.25 grams of fiber per ounce. A serving this size also contains 1 gram of fat, 2 grams of protein, and just 5 mg of sodium.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dietary fiber and high moisture content can aid with digestion, relieve diarrhea, and prevent constipation\r\n2. Fiber acts as a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/does-your-dog-need-probiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probiotic</a>, supporting the growth and activity of helpful bacteria in your dog’s digestive tract\r\n3.

We know to monitor our sodium intake, avoid carrageenan and high fructose corn syrup, and understand that even organic, all-natural potato chips are still chips.\n\n\nPet food products, however, remain a mystery. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet food marketing</a> aims to paint a picture of health (think: images of farms and fresh vegetables on a shelf-stable bag of brown kibble), and every company promises to be the best option for your dog. It’s tempting to throw in the towel on label vigilance in the pet food aisle and blindly believe the bags, but understanding your dog’s food labels is just as important as carefully examining your own.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nStep one: learn to recognize the food label tricks that most pet companies are using.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>First ingredient</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\nJust because an ingredient is listed first on a label, doesn’t mean it’s the most potent in the product. Pet food companies know that most consumers are searching for a real meat source in that prized first ingredient slot. It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\n<h4>Natural</h4>\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\n\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible.

Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible. Stick to foods you can see and the whole feeding process becomes a lot less tricky.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenikrauze/">@jenikrauze</a></em>', 'The 11 Dog Food Label Tricks Every Owner Needs to Know', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '145-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:57:51', '2018-04-09 08:57:51', '', 145, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/145-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Packed with dietary fiber and potassium, pumpkins are a superfood that can benefit your dog’s health (and waistline) all year.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA cup of plain pumpkin contains about 80 calories with a whopping 10 grams of dietary fiber – that’s about 1.25 grams of fiber per ounce. A serving this size also contains 1 gram of fat, 2 grams of protein, and just 5 mg of sodium.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dietary fiber and high moisture content can aid with digestion, relieve diarrhea, and prevent constipation\r\n2. Fiber acts as a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/does-your-dog-need-probiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probiotic</a>, supporting the growth and activity of helpful bacteria in your dog’s digestive tract\r\n3. Natural oils in both pumpkin and pumpkin seeds are rich in phytoestrogens, which can lower blood pressure and support heart health\r\n4. Pumpkin (like other <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">orange veggies</a>) is rich in beta-carotene and other antioxidants which may reduce your dog’s risk for cancer and can promote healthy vision\r\n5. Loaded with vitamin A for <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/how-to-keep-your-dogs-skin-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy skin</a>, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/wikipup-canine-dental-hygiene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teeth</a>, and bones\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How to Feed It:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPumpkin can be incorporated into your dog’s diet in a variety of ways. If your dog is suffering from diarrhea or constipation, try stirring a tablespoon or two of canned pumpkin into his normal food once a day to relieve symptoms. Feeling a little more culinary? Toast <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/superfoods-kitchen-pumpkin-seeds-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raw pumpkin seeds</a> at home with a drizzle of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/superfoods-kitchen-coconut-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coconut</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/olive-oil-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">olive</a> oil and serve them as a tasty treat, or grind them up and stir them into your dog’s food. You can also combine canned pumpkin with a cup of plain yogurt and freeze the mixture in ice cube trays for a refreshing, DIY treat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What to Watch For:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlways be sure to buy plain canned pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling. When it comes to your dog’s digestive system, added sugar and spice are anything but nice.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="http://www.food52.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Food52</a></em>', 'Superfoods in Your Kitchen: Pumpkins for Dogs', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '157-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 08:58:36', '2018-04-09 08:58:36', '', 157, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/157-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Used both as garnish and an ingredient, parsley comes in several different varieties. Flat-leaf parsley, also known as Italian parsley, has large, flat leaves and adds robust flavors in cooking (think soups, stews, and sauces) while curly parsley is primarily used for decoration. But it’s more than just a pretty face.\r\nThe Stats:\r\n\r\nPer tablespoon of chopped herb, parsley contains just 1 calorie and no fat or cholesterol. It contains less than 1 gram of carbohydrates, fiber, and protein but it is fairly rich in Vitamins A, C, and K as well as trace minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Parsley also boasts several volatile oils which have natural anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their antimicrobial and carminative benefits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to parsley for dogs, you should only feed the curly variety. Watch those serving sizes, as parsley does contain a toxic compound called furanocoumarin which can be dangerous in excessive amounts. In smaller servings, however, parsley does your dog more good than harm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Benefits:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Freshens bad breath thanks to microbial properties\r\n2. Rich in antioxidants that protect against free-radical damage\r\n3. Relieves swelling and pain from arthritis and other inflammatory conditions\r\n4. Vitamin K content improves blood clotting and boosts liver health\r\n5. Helps soothe upset stomach and digestive problems\r\n6. Diuretic properties help prevent urinary tract infections\r\n7. Immune system support via Vitamin C\r\n8. Helps flush toxins from the body, supporting kidney health\r\n9. Vitamin A content supports vision and eye health\r\n10. Can slow the rate of growth for tumors and certain cancers\r\nHow to Feed It:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWondering how to incorporate parsley into your dog’s diet? He may not chomp down on a fresh bunch right off the bat, but adding a little to his regular food a few times a week should do the trick. If you’re concerned about accidentally giving your dog too much parsley, play it safe by blending with water (1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight) and creating a juice you can pour right into your his water bowl. You can also brew parsley root into a tea (1 teaspoon per 10 pounds of bodyweight), or bake some into homemade dog treats.

Packed with a powerful flavor punch, this elixir works well in homemade salad dressings, juices, and wellness shots and has big benefits for both humans and dogs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nApple cider vinegar, better known as ACV to health junkies, is made by extracting the juice from crushed apples and mixing it with beneficial bacteria and yeast. This starts the process of fermentation, through which natural sugars are converted to alcohol and, eventually, vinegar. High levels of natural enzymes and beneficial bacteria have made ACV a go-to natural remedy for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Acts as a digestive aid to regulate digestion and relieve digestive upset\r\n2. Works as a tonic for the <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/a-dog-a-uti-and-a-vulva-one-pups-uterine-saga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urinary tract system</a>  to prevent UTIs, bladder and kidney stones\r\n3. May help to alleviate or reduce <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/remedies-for-your-dogs-allergies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allergic reactions</a>\r\n4. Improves <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/winter-hack-prepping-paws-for-snow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cold weather</a> tolerance\r\n5. Naturally clears up bacterial and fungal infections, particularly in the skin\r\n6. Fights tooth decay and may <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/natural-remedies-for-dogs-with-bad-breath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve breath</a>\r\n7. Improves the growth and condition of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/how-to-keep-your-dogs-skin-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy skin and coat</a>\r\n8. Works as a natural antibiotic to protect against bacterial diseases\r\n9. Helps to reduce itchy skin, flakiness, and dander\r\n10. May help balance internal pH levels which can protect against disease\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How to Feed It:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to offer your dog apple cider vinegar is to add some to his water bowl. Use no more than one tablespoon per 50 pounds of bodyweight and limit your use to twice a week. If your dog doesn’t like the strong flavor, try reducing the amount to 1 teaspoon per 50 pounds of bodyweight, cooking it into a homemade dog treat, or stirring some into your dog’s <a href="http://www.thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh meals</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Other Uses:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog won’t ingest apple cider vinegar because of the taste, you can still use it as a natural ear cleaner or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/diy-guide-grooming-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIY</a> flea repellant rinse. To make an ear cleaning solution, mix equal parts water and apple cider vinegar, then dip a cotton ball in the solution and gently use it to clean your dog’s ears. For a DIY flea rinse, mix 1 cup distilled water with ½ cup each of apple cider vinegar and brewed green tea (cooled) and then apply it to your dog’s coat after bathing. Massage into his skin, rinse well, and pat dry. Flea-free and flawless. We salute you, ACV.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="http://goop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goop</a> </em>', 'Superfoods in Your Kitchen: Apple Cider Vinegar for Dogs', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '172-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:25:08', '2018-04-09 09:25:08', '', 172, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/172-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It’s had supporting roles in Thanksgiving stuffings and frequently stars alongside rosemary and thyme in various poultry recipes. But how much do you know about the benefits of sage for dogs?\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\nSage comes in different forms that have both medicinal and culinary applications. Garden sage (<i>Salvia officinalis</i>) is the most common variety, known for its soft, silvery green leaves. Pineapple sage (<i>Salvia elegans</i>) is highly attractive to hummingbirds and is used more for its medicinal benefits than for its flavor. Both golden sage and purple sage are grown ornamentally and for culinary application, while Berggarten sage produces particularly large, aromatic leaves. In addition to having a wonderful flavor and aroma, sage offers natural antiseptic, antibacterial, antimicrobial, and astringent properties.\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n1.  Contains Vitamins A, E, and K which support bone, skin, and eye health in addition to promoting healthy immunity\r\n2. Loaded with trace minerals like calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and zinc to support balanced nutrition\r\n3. The astringent properties of sage reduce redness and inflammation to heal skin infections\r\n4. Sage leaves can be used to ease gas or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/every-pet-owner-needs-know-bloat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bloating</a> and to treat gastrointestinal tract infections\r\n5. The leaves of the sage plant contain <em>rosmarinic acid</em> which may reduce the symptoms of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/remedies-for-your-dogs-allergies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seasonal allergies</a>\r\n6. Antioxidant properties which may help to protect against oxidation in the cells and reduce free-radical damage\r\n7. Antimicrobial properties naturally kill harmful pathogens that could cause infection\r\n8. Oils in the plant contain <em>ketones, </em>which can improve mental clarity and protect against cognitive decline\r\n9. Contains dietary fiber which may support healthy digestion and relieve constipation or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/causes-of-dog-diarrhea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diarrhea</a>\r\n10. Natural anti-inflammatory benefits may help relieve arthritis <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-signs-dog-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain</a> and other inflammatory conditions\r\n<h4>How to Feed It:</h4>\r\nThe easiest way to include sage in your dog’s diet is to mix fresh or dried leaves into his food. You can also boil dried sage leaves and Epsom salts in water to create a topical application to heal skin infections. As with many other superfood herbs, you can also bake sage into homemade dog treats.\r\n<h4>What to Watch For:</h4>\r\nUnlike some herbs which can cause digestive upset in large doses, sage is recognized by the ASPCA as being non-toxic for dogs. You should still limit your dog’s intake to a few leaves a day, but there’s no <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">danger of poisoning</a>.\r\n\r\nDo you have any helpful tips for growing sage?

Share the wealth with your pup.\r\n<h4><strong>The Stats:</strong></h4>\r\nPeppermint (<em>m</em><i>entha balsamea</i>) may soothe your dog’s nausea and upset stomach, but in large quantities it can also cause liver or kidney problems. Similarly, spearmint (<em>m</em><em>entha</em><i> spicata</i>) can freshen your dog’s breath and repel fleas, but larger doses could cause diarrhea or vomiting, so <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/skinny-dogs-live-longer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proper portioning</a> is key. The mint family is diverse, with varieties like lavender mint, apple mint, and even pineapple mint. Just be sure to steer clear of Pennyroyal (m<i>entha pulegium</i>), a type of non-culinary mint that is toxic for both people and pets.\r\n<h4><strong>Benefits:</strong></h4>\r\n1. Fresh mint is rich in Vitamins A and C which support healthy bones, skin, and vision as well as immunity\r\n2. It’s full of trace minerals like calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, folate, potassium, and zinc which all play a key role in balanced nutrition\r\n3. Mint leaves are a natural source of dietary fiber which can promote healthy digestion\r\n4. The antioxidant benefits of fresh mint protect against free-radical damage and oxidation in the cells\r\n5. Soothes upset stomach and relieves nausea or diarrhea\r\n6. Contains <em>rosmarinic acid</em> which has been shown to relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergies…\r\n7.  …and <em>menthol</em>, a natural decongestant which can help break up mucus and phlegm, relieving respiratory ailments\r\n8. Relieves symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease and reduces gas\r\n9. The leaves of the plant in particular may help reduce side effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatments\r\n10.

(279, 1, '2018-04-09 09:43:47', '2018-04-09 09:43:47', 'There’s a common misconception that if you aren’t ready to<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-rescue-runways-guide-to-adopting-a-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> adopt a dog</a>, you can’t help a homeless pet. While adoption is one of the biggest ways to make an impact, it’s certainly not the only one. Here are a few creative ways you can get involved and make a real difference in the lives of rescue pets.\r\n<h5>Foster</h5>\r\nMany people can’t commit to a permanent adoption due to busy schedules, traveling, or expenses. Holding off on adopting is a responsible decision when you know you can’t care for an animal long-term, but if you have a two or four week opening on your calendar, fostering might be for you. Plenty of local rescues need foster homes for animals, and sometimes organizations will even pay for all the expenses as long as you can provide love and shelter. It might be hard to say goodbye at the end of the foster stay, but remember that you’ve helped free up space for that organization to take in even more animals.\r\n<h5>Volunteer</h5>\r\nWalk into any shelter and ask if they need help and you’ll be hard pressed to find one that will turn you down. It takes a village to run any nonprofit and when you have animals that need to be cared for, it’s that much more important to have volunteers. Whether you’re looking to help with marketing, fundraising, or simply want to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-importance-of-letting-your-dog-sniff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk dogs</a>, your skill set and time will be put to good use.\r\n<h5>Educate</h5>\r\nSo you’re allergic to anything with four legs but still want to help in the plight to save animals. Become an educator! Often times, rescues already have some sort of program in place to educate the community about helping their local pet population. You can go to schools, religious organizations, or businesses and host a discussion on spay/neuter, how to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dangerous-items-dogs-hiding-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">care for pets</a>, and why adoption is important. Education is one of the most powerful tools in the fight against homelessness for pets.\r\n<h5>Fundraise</h5>\r\nIf you like to host events or plan parties, consider organizing a fundraiser for your local shelter. It can be as simple as a bake sale or as extravagant as a gala; anything you can contribute will be an asset. Partner with a local boutique for a Shop Your Cause event, or ask your gym to host a workout fundraiser. Get creative with it and do something that you enjoy. In the end, your local shelter will appreciate whatever amount you raise.\r\n<h5>Donate</h5>\r\nIf you’re short on time and resources, skip that latte and donate $5 to a rescue of your choice instead. If you want to make a more direct impact, many organizations have a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/hurricane-harvey-how-to-help/">wish list</a> of items they need. You can usually find these lists under the donations tab on their website, or you can reach out to them directly and ask. Whether you can gift a blanket or a month’s supply of heart worm medication, your donation will help an animal in need.\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@butterandwilson</a></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Here’s How to Help Homeless Dogs Without Adopting', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '210-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:43:47', '2018-04-09 09:43:47', '', 210, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/210-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Kai, my 95-pound Dogo Argentino “lap dog” who thinks she’s the size of a chihuahua, has just about every allergy under the sun. No wheat or grains. Absolutely no chicken. Heck, it cost me $1,000 at the dog <em>dermatologist</em> to determine she’s also allergic to the sun. So, yeah, I’m a bit crazy, especially when we’re out and a well-intentioned, dog-loving person offers Kai a treat, which is bound to make her have diarrhea for a week — and/or give her a gnarly rash.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo, you can see why I jumped at the chance to try <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, a food delivery service for our four-legged friends that features <em>real</em> food (tested on humans!), created with board-certified veterinary nutritionists, and is customized to fit individual dog’s needs. It’s great for all dogs, but especially the ones with those special dietary needs like Kai. And after I’ve switched her food countless times, I was so excited to try something new that didn’t involve randomly picking a new “hypo-allergenic” dog food off a shelf at the pet store.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInstead, here’s how The Farmer’s Dog works: You fill out an <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/#signup-box">online questionnaire</a> about your dog’s size, weight, activity level, protein preference (turkey, beef, or pork) etc., then you’ll get back a customized food plan that’s delivered to you every two weeks in pre-portioned packets. You keep 5 at a time in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer (you might have to clear out some of your frozen pizza stash to make room, but you’ll survive). Then you simply feed your pup one of the packets from the fridge at breakfast and one at dinner and you’re done! There’s no measuring or hassle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKai could hardly contain herself when I received the first shipment of food and now that we’re 2 weeks into her new food regimen, there’s no way she’ll settle for kibble again.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are three awesome things that happened in the first two weeks of using The Farmer’s Dog:\r\n<h4><strong>1. My Dog’s Allergies Got SO Much Better</strong></h4>\r\nHow do I know when Kai’s allergies are bad? The easiest sign is that the hair on her head gets splotchy (see photos below). Within a week of eating The Farmer’s Dog food, the area looked significantly better. She wasn’t itchy at all and the sensitive skin on her belly returned to the normal pink color, instead of reddish and irritated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd TMI alert — her poop looked better than ever. Believe me, it’s easy to tell when you have a 95-pound dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Farmer’s Dog food is shipped to you within days of being made in human-grade kitchens in New York and you won’t believe the difference in how it looks and smells compared to the stuff you’ve been feeding your dog. At this point, Kai is probably eating better than I am…\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>2. She LOVES Eating</strong></h4>\r\nKai already loved to eat, but she was next-level excited for mealtime these last few weeks. Even if she was sound asleep on the couch before dinner, all I had to do was walk to the fridge, take out a packet, and start to pour it in her bowl and she would spring into action — with a giant string of drool hanging out of her mouth as she waited. She never reacted like that to her previous kibble dinner. No way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome nights she’d even eat all of her food then return a few minutes later to her bowl and lick it again — just to make sure she hadn’t missed a piece.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>3. I Felt Good About Feeding Her</strong></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter trying out The Farmer’s Dog, I realized I was a crazy and also <strong>lazy</strong> dog mom. After so many failed attempts at finding the right food for her allergy needs, I stuck with a kibble that was fine but not great. I didn’t really think there was anything better out there. She wasn’t itchy or in pain with her old food (I’m not <em>that</em> bad), but after seeing the improvement with The Farmer’s Dog, it was very apparent that there was something soo much better for her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, let’s be honest: her new food plan is more expensive than her kibble (cost per week varies according to the size and needs of your dog, but plans start at about $29 a week), but my dog and her health are 100% worth it. I’ll eat out one fewer time a month or ditch that afternoon Starbucks and quickly find the extra money to keep my furry BFF happy and, most importantly, healthy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images:  </em><a href="http://www.livingly.com/team/Deena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deena Bustillo </a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'My Dog Has Terrible Allergies and This Meal Service Changed All That', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '208-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:43:58', '2018-04-09 09:43:58', '', 208, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/208-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We had met another dog that we thought we wanted, but once we met Dylan we knew he was meant to be part of our family.

He wound up developing HGE and was in hospitals on and off, and we tried so many different brands of food. We thankfully found <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Farmer’s Dog</a> and that has been a game changer!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’re also mom to a beautiful baby girl named Ruby! How did you prepare Dylan for the transition of having a new baby in the house?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen we first had Ruby, we took her blanket from the hospital and put it in Dylan’s bed so he could get familiar with her scent. At first we were very cautious because we didn’t know how he would adjust to a new family member. Now Ruby can’t get enough of him and they are best friends! They love watching <em>The Secret Life of Pets</em> together. They do everything together.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your favorite part of being a mom?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s ALL amazing. I couldn’t be happier.

We’re always trying new things to find out what Ruby likes, which has made us <em>all</em> more health conscious!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What does a typical healthy day look like for you, Dylan, and Ruby? Are there special activities that the three of you share?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan, Ruby, and I have a morning ritual!

This summer, <a href="http://www.dogumenta.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dOGUMENTA (I) NYC</a> is offering pet owners (and lovers) a new opportunity to connect and experience visual art with their dogs. We sat down with founding curator Jessica Dawson to talk about the inspiration behind the exhibit and the biggest lesson dogs can teach us about art.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What inspired the launch of dOGUMENTA?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe project was inspired by my gallery visits with my rescue dog Rocky, whose insights inspired the Dogumenta manifesto “<a href="http://www.dogumenta.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 Things My Dog Taught Me About Art</a>.” I delivered the manifesto at a gallery in Brooklyn last year and felt that it was time for canines to have an art show all their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How did you begin curating the exhibit? What kind of visual artists did you want to include?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce we found our venue partner (Brookfield Place in New York), we started hounding artists whose work we found interesting. All of the artists we’re featuring in the show responded immediately to the concept and understood how it operated on multiple levels at once. Mica Scalin (my creative development consultant and partner) and I vetted their capabilities, and then we brought Rocky with us to studio visits where he could sniff out their ideas in more detail.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRocky has a curious nature that has made him a great curating partner. He developed a rapport with the artists and together we had a dialog to determine which works would be most suitable for exhibition. The process has been really fun and illuminating for us and that’s what we hope to bring to the public in this exhibition.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What approach did the artists take to creating work for dogs?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAll of the artists are excited to frame ideas from their existing practice for a new audience and have been considering dogs’ unique points of view and perception. There will be work about the emotional issues dogs face — <a href="https://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>, which is common — as well as work that speaks to dogs’ interest in certain color schemes (they can see blue, yellow and grey). Works exploring formal, conceptual, and relational issues will be executed in a variety of media from sound and sculpture to kibble and squeaky toys.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBroadly, we know that canines perceive the world in unique ways. Olfaction is essential to their understanding, the color spectrum they see is different from a human’s, and of course they live closer to the ground. They’re also fearless and willing to engage with work in a variety of different ways, like sniffing, peeing, and licking. We expect a really diverse range of interactions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThat said, we hesitate to speak too broadly for an entire species. Just like humans, individual dogs have different attractions and aversions so we are intentionally presenting works that address a variety of aesthetic and conceptual concerns. Some artists are interested in specifics of a dog’s physical perspective or perceptual abilities, while others are more concerned with emotional connections.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe look forward to learning from the show. Will hounds react differently than terriers? Dachshunds vs Dobermans? Each piece of artwork addresses canine viewers differently, so the whole show is an experiment for both the curators and the artists.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you hope visitors will take away from the exhibit?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\ndOGUMENTA offers both the chance for humans to get to know their canine friends better and also the opportunity to approach art differently themselves. Attendees will gain new insights into their companion’s personality and character. It’s an opportunity for bonding and learning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is the biggest lesson dogs have taught you about art?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGo with your gut! Being fearless in the face of art is Rocky’s greatest lesson.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: Jason Falchook</em>', 'Introducing dOGUMENTA, the First Art Show for Dogs', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '202-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:44:37', '2018-04-09 09:44:37', '', 202, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/202-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Unfortunately, my stint as a pre-vet student didn’t last very long after I fainted in my dissection class, so I’ve had to find other ways to help animals.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Chicago-based animal lover spent years volunteering at shelters, and found a new way to make her mark when she created <a href="https://www.therescuerunway.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rescue Runway</a> in February 2017. The popular blog marries her love of animals and fashion by chronicling trips to local shelters and including information on both her outfits and the pictured pups in need of homes. Whenever possible, she tries to wear clothing brands that support and donate proceeds to animal organizations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHer idea has resonated with dog lovers and fashion enthusiasts alike. Within months of its launch, The Rescue Runway was featured in <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/pets/ct-chicago-fashion-blog-shelter-dogs-20170616-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Chicago Tribune</a> and received praise from fashion designer and blogger <a href="https://laurenconrad.com/blog/2017/07/lc-com-edit-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Conrad.</a> “I will never charge shelters for my “services,” so I am constantly looking for ways to partner with like-minded brands who are interested in making a fashionable social statement,” Christine shared with <em>the Digest. </em>“The goal is to make The Rescue Runway my full-time job within the next two years.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe caught up with Christine to talk dogs, blogs, and the biggest lesson animals have taught her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How was the idea for The Rescue Runway born? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI’ve always been an active volunteer at animal shelters in and around Chicago and wanted to find a way to promote adoption to a new audience. I follow many fashion bloggers and love when they share pictures of their pups, and one day I had a light bulb moment. I realized my passion for clothes could be combined with my love of equally adorable dogs (and cats!) in a new kind of fashion blog. A blog that not only shows off fun outfits, but also has a purpose behind it that people can connect with.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>You do a lot of work to raise awareness about homeless pets in Chicago. What has the response from your community been like? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo say it’s been amazing would be an understatement. Since day one, people have reached out from across the city and country telling me how wonderful of a platform this is for the rescue world. I’ve been lucky to meet some pretty incredible people in Chicago who are just as passionate about adoption as I am, and everyone has been so supportive and offered advice along the way. One of my new blogger friends just adopted her first pup and let me know that my blog helped her make the decision!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’ve written about your exploration of the </strong><a href="https://www.therescuerunway.com/single-post/kibbles-and-bits-of-everything" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.therescuerunway.com/single-post/kibbles-and-bits-of-everything&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1501617677812000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIECAyAK7qnfpy4E6X-AZHVlQYIQ"><strong>pet food industry</strong></a><strong> and your experience trying a fresh diet for your dogs Hattrick and Stanley. What’s your approach to feeding them these days? </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWriting that post was quite the eye-opener and it’s completely changed my approach to feeding my pets. Hattrick and Stanley are both working on their summer bodies and were in need of a leaner diet. Luckily, <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a> provided well-balanced meals to kick-start their weight loss goals. I’m happy to report that Stanley has lost five pounds and Hattrick is down three! I’m hoping to switch them to a total human-grade diet by the end of the year, and for now they’re eating a combination of The Farmer’s Dog and a zero-grain dog food to shave off a few more pounds!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is it about animals that makes them so special to you? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI will always be in awe of the unconditional and innocent love that animals possess. Some of my favorite dogs have been the ones who were treated so badly before being saved and are still the sweetest pups and have so much love to give. We can all learn a lesson from them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you hope people learn from visiting The Rescue Runway? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy blog is full of educational posts about things that are all important to me, but I hope the number one takeaway is just how amazing adopting a pet can be. People don’t often realize that you can rescue almost any kind of dog. Big, little, purebred or mutt, the perfect pup is out there waiting for you. It may take a little research, but I promise it’s worth it. I hear from followers all the time that in the end, it’s really the dog that rescues the person.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/therescuerunway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rescue Runway</a>', 'How One Fashion Blogger is Giving Shelter Dogs a Voice', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '200-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:45:08', '2018-04-09 09:45:08', '', 200, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/200-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

A former Wilhelmina model and artist, Lauren was a founding team member at <a href="https://ritual.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ritual</a>, a health tech company that’s reinventing the vitamin through simplicity and traceability. Their first product, a multivitamin for women, contains just nine vitamins and minerals, compared with more than 20 typically found in other supplements.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLauren leads Marketing and Growth at Ritual and is based out of Los Angeles with her husband and two dogs, Rocky and Apollo. We chatted with Lauren about her favorite rituals, how she thinks about nutrition for her pups, and why New Year’s Eve holds a special significance in her house.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Tell us a little bit about your dogs, Rocky and Apollo.</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOur former dog was a 14 year old lab, Rocco, and when he passed away it just felt like there was a void in our house. We had seen this litter of English Retriever puppies and fell in love with two of them. Every day for three months I kept asking my fiancé (now husband) if we could get them. We were really debating it, though, because it’s such a huge responsibility. I’m pregnant, we were planning our wedding, we both work at startups…there’s always a lot going on!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFinally, I talked to my dad about it and he told me to follow my heart and get them. I was inspired by him, so on New Year’s Eve, instead of going to this party we had tickets to, we drove to Long Beach and picked up Rocky and Apollo. We’ve never been happier! Obviously, it was the right decision and we adore them. They’re really good puppies; they understand “no,” they haven’t torn a lot up in our house, and they’re housebroken. We’ve been really lucky in that regard.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How did you choose a pet food when you first got your pups? What was your main criteria in selecting a food? </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy husband and I eat healthy and are conscious of the food we put in our bodies, and we try to do the same for our dogs. I had initially thought that certain dry food brands might be a good option compared to the more mainstream ones, because it seemed like they didn’t have a lot of gross stuff in there. After doing a little bit more research, though, I learned that it was mostly marketing and that a lot of dry food is pretty much the same.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen we discovered <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, and the dogs go so crazy for it. I’ve been uploading photos and videos to my Instagram of them eating the food because it’s the funniest thing. We have these slow feeder maze bowls for them they’re ravenous all the time, and they literally go in circles in the mazes trying to eat their Farmer’s Dog food super fast. There’s always one or two chickpeas that get caught in the maze and they end up flipping over their bowls to get to them! They just love the food.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Did you notice any changes in Rocky and Apollo when you switched them to a fresh food diet?</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat people notice on our dogs is that their fur is super silky. It’s gorgeous and so thick and soft! I would say an improvement in fur is one big thing. They’re very happy and super healthy all around, and I’m sure the food has a lot to do with that.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How has switching to fresh food changed the way you think about their nutrition?</b><b> </b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think people should just think about it the same way they think about feeding themselves. Would you eat Lucky Charms for every meal, every day? Probably not. Our dogs are living, breathing creatures and require real nutrients. The quality of the nutrients we get from fresh foods like vegetables and meat is so much higher than it would be in processed food. I really try to apply the same principles of what I feed myself to what I feed my dogs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>In honor of your company, Ritual, tell us about your favorite rituals with Rocky and Apollo.</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThey’re always so excited to see me when I get home from work! Since I’m pregnant I’m usually really tired at the end of the day and get right in bed. They’re not supposed to come in the bed, but they’re irresistibly cute and I usually let them. My favorite daily ritual is just spending quality time with them and giving them lots of love.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/laurenahayes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Hayes </a></em>', 'This Dog Mom is Reinventing the Vitamin for Women', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '198-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:45:43', '2018-04-09 09:45:43', '', 198, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/198-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

An associate veterinarian at the Belle Haven Animal Medical Centre in Virginia and expert in animal health and nutrition, she is also the host and executive producer of <a href="http://www.thepetshow.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Pet Show with Dr. Katy</em></a>. Dr. Katy has been featured on the TODAY Show, Fox &amp; Friends, NPR, CNBC, The Meredith Vieira Show, and HuffPost Live, among others.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe sat down with Dr. Katy to talk about the importance of choosing the right diet for your dog, the advice she would give every aspiring vet, and why she’s dedicated her life to animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Tell us a little bit about your career path. When did you first know you wanted to be a veterinarian?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI grew up in South Louisiana and animals were always a huge part of my life. You name it, we had it — chickens, cows, even the occasional rabbit.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy dad’s best friend was a veterinarian when I was growing up, and one summer in college he told me about a job opening at a small local zoo. I was pre-med at the time, but I went and worked and a six week position turned into 13 weeks. I absolutely loved it and thought, “This is it. This is what I want to do.” I went back to school that fall and changed my major to a pre-vet track. Two years after that, I went to Louisiana State University’s School of Veterinary Medicine.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s one piece of advice you would give to someone who wants to become a vet?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think the biggest mistake people make when they go into veterinary medicine is thinking, “I don’t want to work with people; I just want to work with animals!” One of the biggest parts of our job is actually people relations. Like pediatricians, we have patients who can’t talk and can’t tell us where it hurts, and we have very concerned parents advocating for them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy biggest piece of advice for someone who wants to be a veterinarian is to take psychology, economics, and business classes. Having interpersonal communication skills and being business savvy is a big part of being a really good vet. Vets are highly intelligent people with big hearts, but most of them are also small business owners and there actually isn’t any business training in veterinary school.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce you make the decision that being a vet is what you want, dive in and study hard. It ain’t easy!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’re very vocal about the importance of nutrition for dogs. How big of an impact do you think food has on our dogs’ health and well-being?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs a mom, I’ve really delved hard into thinking about what I’m putting in my kids’ bodies. We all put so much time and interest into what we’re eating because we know it has an impact. We are what we eat, and the same thing goes for our pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf we’re feeding our pets protein that is so highly processed it’s lost all of its nutritional integrity, we’re not doing them any favors. It’s certainly cheaper in the moment, but it’s actually not cheaper in the long run when you consider that poor diet can cause diseases and health issues like diabetes down the line. If we start with good nutrition from day one, we have a heck of a better chance of our pets living long and healthy lives.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What advice do you give pet owners who are trying to choose the best food for their dog?</strong><b>\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA lot of pet health really has to do with choosing the right food for your dog. People think they’re feeding their dog really wonderful food because they’ve read a review online, or the 19-year-old restocking the shelves at the local pet store told them it was a great brand. What you really need to do is have a conversation with your vet. Your vet is going to be able to better assess your pet’s lifestyle and caloric needs and help you figure it all out.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat really impresses me so much about <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a> is that you guys are doing what I’ve been telling people to do for years. You’ve got the algorithms in place to account for lifestyle, disease, body condition, etc. and feed dogs accordingly. Pet owners need to figure out the right daily calorie count for their dogs and stick to it, remembering that treats are extra on top of that. I think one of the hardest things is for people to be honest about that. Sometimes it’s just easier not to think about it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What are some of the biggest health issues our pets are facing today? How can pet owners protect their dogs?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think the biggest epidemic we’re seeing in pets is definitely obesity. Almost 60% of American dogs are overweight or obese. That’s shocking!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe obesity issue stems from a lack of nutritional education and a lack of being able to recognize pet obesity by owners. In a study conducted by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention (APOP), pet owners were surveyed about their dogs’ weights. 100% of the dogs included in the study were considered obese, yet <em>90% of the owners</em> <em>polled</em> said their dogs were a normal weight!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPeople are completely in denial about what is and isn’t a healthy weight for their pets, but we have to start being realistic and treating pet obesity as seriously as we treat other health issues like thyroid conditions, heart disease and even cancer. We have the science to prove that pets who weigh less live longer, and we all want to give our dogs the longest, happiest lives possible. A massive part of that is nutrition. When we’re feeding our dogs good things, it translates to good health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy biggest piece of advice would be to talk with your vet and not take it personally if they tell you that your dog is overweight. Obesity is a diagnosis of a disease, not something to get offended over. They’re not saying <i>you’re</i> a bad pet owner, they’re saying your pet has a disease and it’s one you can treat and work on together as a team. If you look at it that way, you’ll have a lot more results than if you get defensive about what you’re feeding or how much exercise your dog is getting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Such important advice. Lastly, from one crazy dog lover to another, what do you think it is about dogs that makes them so special?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat I think is really cool is that in the last couple of years, even the Pope has spoken out about animals having souls. I think that’s something that we have known for years as dog owners. I know that when I look into my dog’s eyes there is a soul in there and a sentient being who loves me unconditionally, the way that I love him. It’s been validating that there have been so many books published over the last few years about how dogs touch our souls and communicate with us.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to connect with a dog, soul to soul. There are no pretenses and you don’t need makeup or your best clothes. Dogs aren’t going to judge you; they just love you. I think everyone’s goal is to find that unconditional love in life, and whether or not we find it in another human, we know our dogs love us unconditionally. Dogs give us the comfort and connection that everyone is seeking.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Images: <a href="http://www.thepetshow.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katy Nelson</a></em>', 'Vets We Love: Meet Dr. Katy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '196-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:45:54', '2018-04-09 09:45:54', '', 196, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/196-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Kai, my 95-pound Dogo Argentino “lap dog” who thinks she’s the size of a chihuahua, has just about every allergy under the sun. No wheat or grains. Absolutely no chicken. Heck, it cost me $1,000 at the dog <em>dermatologist</em> to determine she’s also allergic to the sun. So, yeah, I’m a bit crazy, especially when we’re out and a well-intentioned, dog-loving person offers Kai a treat, which is bound to make her have diarrhea for a week — and/or give her a gnarly rash.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo, you can see why I jumped at the chance to try <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Farmer’s Dog</a>, a food delivery service for our four-legged friends that features <em>real</em> food (tested on humans!), created with board-certified veterinary nutritionists, and is customized to fit individual dog’s needs. It’s great for all dogs, but especially the ones with those special dietary needs like Kai. And after I’ve switched her food countless times, I was so excited to try something new that didn’t involve randomly picking a new “hypo-allergenic” dog food off a shelf at the pet store.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInstead, here’s how The Farmer’s Dog works: You fill out an <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/#signup-box">online questionnaire</a> about your dog’s size, weight, activity level, protein preference (turkey, beef, or pork) etc., then you’ll get back a customized food plan that’s delivered to you every two weeks in pre-portioned packets. You keep 5 at a time in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer (you might have to clear out some of your frozen pizza stash to make room, but you’ll survive). Then you simply feed your pup one of the packets from the fridge at breakfast and one at dinner and you’re done! There’s no measuring or hassle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKai could hardly contain herself when I received the first shipment of food and now that we’re 2 weeks into her new food regimen, there’s no way she’ll settle for kibble again.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are three awesome things that happened in the first two weeks of using The Farmer’s Dog:\r\n<h4><strong>1. My Dog’s Allergies Got SO Much Better</strong></h4>\r\nHow do I know when Kai’s allergies are bad? The easiest sign is that the hair on her head gets splotchy (see photos below). Within a week of eating The Farmer’s Dog food, the area looked significantly better. She wasn’t itchy at all and the sensitive skin on her belly returned to the normal pink color, instead of reddish and irritated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd TMI alert — her poop looked better than ever. Believe me, it’s easy to tell when you have a 95-pound dog.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Farmer’s Dog food is shipped to you within days of being made in human-grade kitchens in New York and you won’t believe the difference in how it looks and smells compared to the stuff you’ve been feeding your dog. At this point, Kai is probably eating better than I am…\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>2. She LOVES Eating</strong></h4>\r\nKai already loved to eat, but she was next-level excited for mealtime these last few weeks. Even if she was sound asleep on the couch before dinner, all I had to do was walk to the fridge, take out a packet, and start to pour it in her bowl and she would spring into action — with a giant string of drool hanging out of her mouth as she waited. She never reacted like that to her previous kibble dinner. No way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome nights she’d even eat all of her food then return a few minutes later to her bowl and lick it again — just to make sure she hadn’t missed a piece.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>3. I Felt Good About Feeding Her</strong></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter trying out The Farmer’s Dog, I realized I was a crazy and also <strong>lazy</strong> dog mom. After so many failed attempts at finding the right food for her allergy needs, I stuck with a kibble that was fine but not great. I didn’t really think there was anything better out there.

When she isn’t collaborating with athleisure brands like Bandier or developing her own fashion line, Arielle soaks up quality time with her 1-year-old daughter, Ruby Lou. Instagram followers can’t get enough of the mother-daughter duo, and Arielle’s feed is full of candid videos of the pair sharing dance parties, watching their favorite movies, and eating home cooked meals together. We caught up with the powerhouse NYC mom about her dog, Dylan, and her favorite morning rituals with her family.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>When did you first become a dog mom? Tell us a little bit about Dylan and what makes your relationship special.</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI got Dylan 5 years ago with my boyfriend (now husband) as our first dog together. We had met another dog that we thought we wanted, but once we met Dylan we knew he was meant to be part of our family. Dylan is so special to us because he was my first “born.” He started our family, which has now grown into four along with his baby sister, Ruby.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How do you prioritize Dylan’s health in your daily routine? </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan’s health has always been very important to us and we always thought we were giving him the best. He wound up developing HGE and was in hospitals on and off, and we tried so many different brands of food. We thankfully found <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Farmer’s Dog</a> and that has been a game changer!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>You’re also mom to a beautiful baby girl named Ruby! How did you prepare Dylan for the transition of having a new baby in the house?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen we first had Ruby, we took her blanket from the hospital and put it in Dylan’s bed so he could get familiar with her scent. At first we were very cautious because we didn’t know how he would adjust to a new family member. Now Ruby can’t get enough of him and they are best friends! They love watching <em>The Secret Life of Pets</em> together. They do everything together.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your favorite part of being a mom?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s ALL amazing. I couldn’t be happier. But the best part is waking her up every morning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How has your view of health changed since having Ruby?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSince having Ruby, we are constantly cooking at home. We’re always trying new things to find out what Ruby likes, which has made us <em>all</em> more health conscious!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What does a typical healthy day look like for you, Dylan, and Ruby? Are there special activities that the three of you share?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDylan, Ruby, and I have a morning ritual!

Used both as garnish and an ingredient, parsley comes in several different varieties. Flat-leaf parsley, also known as Italian parsley, has large, flat leaves and adds robust flavors in cooking (think soups, stews, and sauces) while curly parsley is primarily used for decoration. But it’s more than just a pretty face.\r\nThe Stats:\r\n\r\nPer tablespoon of chopped herb, parsley contains just 1 calorie and no fat or cholesterol. It contains less than 1 gram of carbohydrates, fiber, and protein but it is fairly rich in Vitamins A, C, and K as well as trace minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Parsley also boasts several volatile oils which have natural anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their antimicrobial and carminative benefits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to parsley for dogs, you should only feed the curly variety. Watch those serving sizes, as parsley does contain a toxic compound called furanocoumarin which can be dangerous in excessive amounts. In smaller servings, however, parsley does your dog more good than harm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Benefits:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Freshens bad breath thanks to microbial properties\r\n2. Rich in antioxidants that protect against free-radical damage\r\n3. Relieves swelling and pain from arthritis and other inflammatory conditions\r\n4. Vitamin K content improves blood clotting and boosts liver health\r\n5. Helps soothe upset stomach and digestive problems\r\n6. Diuretic properties help prevent urinary tract infections\r\n7. Immune system support via Vitamin C\r\n8. Helps flush toxins from the body, supporting kidney health\r\n9. Vitamin A content supports vision and eye health\r\n10. Can slow the rate of growth for tumors and certain cancers\r\nHow to Feed It:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWondering how to incorporate parsley into your dog’s diet? He may not chomp down on a fresh bunch right off the bat, but adding a little to his regular food a few times a week should do the trick. If you’re concerned about accidentally giving your dog too much parsley, play it safe by blending with water (1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight) and creating a juice you can pour right into your his water bowl. You can also brew parsley root into a tea (1 teaspoon per 10 pounds of bodyweight), or bake some into homemade dog treats.

Packed with dietary fiber and potassium, pumpkins are a superfood that can benefit your dog’s health (and waistline) all year.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Stats:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA cup of plain pumpkin contains about 80 calories with a whopping 10 grams of dietary fiber – that’s about 1.25 grams of fiber per ounce. A serving this size also contains 1 gram of fat, 2 grams of protein, and just 5 mg of sodium.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dietary fiber and high moisture content can aid with digestion, relieve diarrhea, and prevent constipation\r\n2. Fiber acts as a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/does-your-dog-need-probiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probiotic</a>, supporting the growth and activity of helpful bacteria in your dog’s digestive tract\r\n3. Natural oils in both pumpkin and pumpkin seeds are rich in phytoestrogens, which can lower blood pressure and support heart health\r\n4. Pumpkin (like other <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">orange veggies</a>) is rich in beta-carotene and other antioxidants which may reduce your dog’s risk for cancer and can promote healthy vision\r\n5.

If your dog is suffering from diarrhea or constipation, try stirring a tablespoon or two of canned pumpkin into his normal food once a day to relieve symptoms. Feeling a little more culinary? Toast <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/superfoods-kitchen-pumpkin-seeds-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raw pumpkin seeds</a> at home with a drizzle of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/superfoods-kitchen-coconut-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coconut</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/olive-oil-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">olive</a> oil and serve them as a tasty treat, or grind them up and stir them into your dog’s food. You can also combine canned pumpkin with a cup of plain yogurt and freeze the mixture in ice cube trays for a refreshing, DIY treat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>What to Watch For:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlways be sure to buy plain canned pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling.

(291, 1, '2018-04-09 09:48:12', '2018-04-09 09:48:12', 'Health-conscious consumers are skilled at deciphering nutrition facts labels. We know to monitor our sodium intake, avoid carrageenan and high fructose corn syrup, and understand that even organic, all-natural potato chips are still chips.\r\n\r\nPet food products, however, remain a mystery. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet food marketing</a> aims to paint a picture of health (think: images of farms and fresh vegetables on a shelf-stable bag of brown kibble), and every company promises to be the best option for your dog. It’s tempting to throw in the towel on label vigilance in the pet food aisle and blindly believe the bags, but understanding your dog’s food labels is just as important as carefully examining your own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStep one: learn to recognize the food label tricks that most pet companies are using.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>First ingredient</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust because an ingredient is listed first on a label, doesn’t mean it’s the most potent in the product. Pet food companies know that most consumers are searching for a real meat source in that prized first ingredient slot. It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Natural</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible. Stick to foods you can see and the whole feeding process becomes a lot less tricky.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenikrauze/">@jenikrauze</a></em>', 'The 11 Dog Food Label Tricks Every Owner Needs to Know', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '176-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:48:12', '2018-04-09 09:48:12', '', 176, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/176-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It’s a good time to review the most <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-most-dangerous-foods-for-dogs/">dangerous foods for your dog</a> (toxic ingredients like onion and garlic are often hidden in dishes like soups and stews), but contrary to popular belief, not all table food is bad for our dogs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo where does this myth come from?<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/"> Marketing, for starters</a>. After the invention of processed dog food, manufacturers were still struggling to successfully convince pet owners to replace real food with new, commercial varieties. So in the mid 1960s, the pet food industry launched a marketing campaign imploring consumers to “Ban All Table Scraps” from their pets’ bowls and switch to dry kibble. It worked, and we’ve been scared to give our dogs human food ever since. While the kibble guys were right in that you don’t want to train your dog to beg at the table or feed those garlic potatoes you just fried up, most people are starting to understand that a fresh food diet is a much healthier option for dogs. What some pet owners may not know is that even feeding the right table scraps can also be healthful and beneficial.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><b>How</b><b> do I know what “real” foods I can feed my dog?</b></h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAvoid anything fried or cooked with additives and stick with <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/">whole, fresh foods</a> like meat, vegetables, and fruit. These are best in their natural states or lightly cooked, and are not only safe for your dogs, but also beneficial for their health. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/">Fresh food is also easier for your pup to digest</a> than processed dog food and can lead to better breath, a shinier coat, and a trimmer waistline.

Everyone knows about chocolate, but here’s a quick recap of the table scraps that still deserve their bad rep.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Fried foods or dishes with added salt and spices\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Most Americans cook with copious amounts of butter and oil, making many holiday dishes a potential nutritional land mine for dogs (and humans)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Garlic and onion (they contain <i>allium</i>, which can damage your dog’s red blood cells and even cause them to burst)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Grapes and raisins (the exact toxin in this fruit family hasn’t been pinpointed, but grapes are high on the No Fly List for your dog’s bowl)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Packaged foods (artificial sweeteners like <em>x</em><em>ylitol</em> can sneak into packaged desserts, candies, and condiments and are some of the most dangerous ingredients for dogs)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Peaches and avocados (peach pits are poisonous, to say nothing of their danger as a choking hazard, while avocados contain a toxin called <i>persin</i>)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Tomato plants (a ripe tomato is fine, but a green tomato or any part of the plant itself can be toxic)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Cooked bones (chicken bones, we’re looking at you)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n– Raw potatoes (cooked is safe, but skip the buttery mashed variety)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhile your pup would no doubt love a plate of macaroni and cheese this holiday, rich foods can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and even pancreatitis if consumed in high quantities. The good news is that your dog will be just as happy enjoying a plate of steamed Brussels sprouts dressed in Turkey broth. So go ahead, put some leftover superfoods in that bowl and let the dogs join in on the holiday fun this year.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ps.ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ps.ny</a></em>', 'The Truth About Table Scraps for Dogs', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '174-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 09:48:22', '2018-04-09 09:48:22', '', 174, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/174-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

If your dog doesn’t like the strong flavor, try reducing the amount to 1 teaspoon per 50 pounds of bodyweight, cooking it into a homemade dog treat, or stirring some into your dog’s <a href="http://www.thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh meals</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Other Uses:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog won’t ingest apple cider vinegar because of the taste, you can still use it as a natural ear cleaner or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/diy-guide-grooming-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIY</a> flea repellant rinse. To make an ear cleaning solution, mix equal parts water and apple cider vinegar, then dip a cotton ball in the solution and gently use it to clean your dog’s ears. For a DIY flea rinse, mix 1 cup distilled water with ½ cup each of apple cider vinegar and brewed green tea (cooled) and then apply it to your dog’s coat after bathing. Massage into his skin, rinse well, and pat dry. Flea-free and flawless.

It’s been used in cooking for thousands of years and is primarily comprised of monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, and antioxidants. It contains about 120 calories per tablespoon and 14 grams of fat (the good kind!).\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n1. Monounsaturated fatty acids support fat breakdown in the cells, helping to shed stored fat\r\n2. Antioxidant content protects against free-radical damage and oxidation to increase lifespan\r\n3. Natural anti-inflammatory properties help reduce the risk for serious diseases like cancer, heart\r\ndisease, and diabetes\r\n4.

Just don’t serve your dog salad that’s been slathered in dressing. Servings should be limited to one teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight per day.\r\n<h4>What to Watch For:</h4>\r\nBe careful with what kind of olive oil you choose and how much you feed your pup. Stick to extra virgin olive oil, since it has a lower acid content than other olive oils.

Garden sage (<i>Salvia officinalis</i>) is the most common variety, known for its soft, silvery green leaves. Pineapple sage (<i>Salvia elegans</i>) is highly attractive to hummingbirds and is used more for its medicinal benefits than for its flavor. Both golden sage and purple sage are grown ornamentally and for culinary application, while Berggarten sage produces particularly large, aromatic leaves. In addition to having a wonderful flavor and aroma, sage offers natural antiseptic, antibacterial, antimicrobial, and astringent properties.\r\n<h4>The Benefits:</h4>\r\n1.  Contains Vitamins A, E, and K which support bone, skin, and eye health in addition to promoting healthy immunity\r\n2. Loaded with trace minerals like calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and zinc to support balanced nutrition\r\n3. The astringent properties of sage reduce redness and inflammation to heal skin infections\r\n4. Sage leaves can be used to ease gas or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/every-pet-owner-needs-know-bloat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bloating</a> and to treat gastrointestinal tract infections\r\n5.

Probiotics are good microbes (either bacteria or yeasts) that live in the digestive tract and help fight off the growth and activity of bad bacteria like E. coli and salmonella. In humans, they can boost our immune systems and improve gastrointestinal issues like diarrhea, IBS, and intestinal inflammations. While there are fewer studies on the effects of probiotics on dogs, there are a few known strains that can help your pup with digestion and upset stomach.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog is experiencing stomach troubles, your vet might suggest one of two alternatives: prebiotics work with the good bacteria already living in your dog’s colon to nourish it and promote growth, while probiotics nourish and combat any bad bacteria that might have infected your dog. Consult with your vet on the best option for your pup.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMany pet owners supplement their dogs’ diets with probiotics when they are experiencing gastrointestinal issues, many of which are caused by a highly processed diet of dry kibble. <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fresh, lightly cooked food</a>, on the other hand, is notoriously easier to digest than <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commercial pet foods</a>, and most dogs on a fresh diet do not require any additional probiotic supplements.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStill, adding probiotics to your dog’s diet isn’t any more harmful than your midday kombucha habit.

Used both as garnish and an ingredient, parsley comes in several different varieties. Flat-leaf parsley, also known as Italian parsley, has large, flat leaves and adds robust flavors in cooking (think soups, stews, and sauces) while curly parsley is primarily used for decoration. But it’s more than just a pretty face.\r\nThe Stats:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPer tablespoon of chopped herb, parsley contains just 1 calorie and no fat or cholesterol. It contains less than 1 gram of carbohydrates, fiber, and protein but it is fairly rich in Vitamins A, C, and K as well as trace minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Parsley also boasts several volatile oils which have natural anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their antimicrobial and carminative benefits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to parsley for dogs, you should only feed the curly variety. Watch those serving sizes, as parsley does contain a toxic compound called furanocoumarin which can be dangerous in excessive amounts. In smaller servings, however, parsley does your dog more good than harm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Benefits:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Freshens bad breath thanks to microbial properties\r\n2. Rich in antioxidants that protect against free-radical damage\r\n3. Relieves swelling and pain from arthritis and other inflammatory conditions\r\n4.

We know to monitor our sodium intake, avoid carrageenan and high fructose corn syrup, and understand that even organic, all-natural potato chips are still chips.\r\n\r\nPet food products, however, remain a mystery. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet food marketing</a> aims to paint a picture of health (think: images of farms and fresh vegetables on a shelf-stable bag of brown kibble), and every company promises to be the best option for your dog. It’s tempting to throw in the towel on label vigilance in the pet food aisle and blindly believe the bags, but understanding your dog’s food labels is just as important as carefully examining your own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStep one: learn to recognize the food label tricks that most pet companies are using.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>First ingredient</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust because an ingredient is listed first on a label, doesn’t mean it’s the most potent in the product. Pet food companies know that most consumers are searching for a real meat source in that prized first ingredient slot. It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Natural</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible.

In addition to the emotional distress that Halloween can cause, that bowl of candy by the front door is also treacherous for any pet. Keep your dog away from these tricks in the treat bucket this Halloween.\r\n<h4>Chocolate</h4>\r\nWhether or not you have kids, chocolate is bound to make its way into your house this Halloween. Most dog owners are already aware of the dangers of chocolate for dogs, but here’s a quick refresher. The villain is a molecule found in chocolate known as <em>theobromine,</em> which is very difficult for dogs to digest. Not all chocolate is equally poisonous; dark chocolate contains more than six times the amount of the deadly molecule than milk chocolate, which means those Kit Kat Halloween Darkness candies are especially spooky. Smaller dogs are at a greater risk of getting sick than bigger breeds, and symptoms include vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, and increased heart rate. If ingested in large quantities, this sinister treat can lead to death, so keep that candy bowl far out of reach.\r\n<h4>Garlic</h4>\r\nGarlic is a key weapon in the fight against vampires, but it can also have adverse effects on your dog’s health. Garlic contains thiosulfate which damages red blood cells and can cause anemia. This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n<h4>Raisins</h4>\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n<h4>Candy</h4>\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach. Instead of chocolate or candy, chop up some <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh treats</a> for your dog to enjoy, like apples or carrots. They may not be as decadent as your treats, but your dog’s health is a far better investment.

Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\r\nWhy do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?\r\n\r\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\r\n\r\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\r\n\r\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\r\n\r\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. teeth, nails, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\r\nGrooming by coat type\r\n\r\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\r\n\r\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog? Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\r\n\r\nSome dogs also have an undercoat, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\r\nHow does your dog’s diet affect coat health?\r\n\r\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair. The important ones here are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (both of which you can find in superfoods like olive oil!). Omega-3s help to reduce general inflammation, which can cut down on dander and combat any bites or allergies, while omega-6s stimulate hair growth. A healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids ultimately results in a strong and lustrous coat.\r\n\r\nIf you think your dog might have an omega-3 or omega-6 deficiency, you can supplement his diet with fish or flaxseed oil or switch to a fresh, balanced meal plan. If you’re home cooking for your dog or supplementing yourself, check in with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure that you’re feeding a balanced diet. Brushing, bathing, and feeding your dog right?

A healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids ultimately results in a strong and lustrous coat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you think your dog might have an omega-3 or omega-6 deficiency, you can supplement his diet with fish or flaxseed oil or switch to a fresh, balanced meal plan. If you’re home cooking for your dog or supplementing yourself, check in with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure that you’re feeding a balanced diet. Brushing, bathing, and feeding your dog right?

Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\r\n<h5><strong>Why do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. teeth, nails, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>Grooming by coat type</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog? Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome dogs also have an undercoat, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How does your dog’s diet affect coat health?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair. The important ones here are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (both of which you can find in superfoods like olive oil!). Omega-3s help to reduce general inflammation, which can cut down on dander and combat any bites or allergies, while omega-6s stimulate hair growth. A healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids ultimately results in a strong and lustrous coat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you think your dog might have an omega-3 or omega-6 deficiency, you can supplement his diet with fish or flaxseed oil or switch to a fresh, balanced meal plan.

There are times, however, when something goes awry and your dog’s digestive system stops working as smoothly as it should.\r\n\r\nConstipation is a condition characterized by difficult, infrequent, or completely absent bowel movements. Dogs are normally very regular, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/decoding-your-dogs-poop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">producing stools</a> once or twice a day, but they are just as prone to digestive difficulties as humans. Here is what you need to know about constipation in your<em> </em>dog.\r\n<h4>What Causes Constipation in Dogs?</h4>\r\nConstipation is one of the most common digestive problems seen in dogs and is typically easy to diagnose. Some of the most common symptoms of constipation include:\r\n\r\n1. Forceful but ineffective attempts to defecate\r\n2. Small, hard, or dry stools Redness or swelling around the anus\r\n3. Discharge from the anus after defecating\r\n4. Loss of appetite and/or weight loss\r\n5. Lethargy or depression\r\n6. Pain when defecating\r\n7. Scooting the bottom on the floor\r\n\r\nIf your dog hasn’t had a bowel movement in more than a day or two, it is a sure sign of constipation. But what exactly leads to constipation?\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of causes ranging from inadequate fiber content in your dog’s diet to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/save-your-dog-from-summertime-sadness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>. Constipation can also be caused by an enlarged prostate gland, excessive self-grooming, injury or trauma to the pelvis, and various neurological disorders. It can also be a side effect of certain medications or the result of an intestinal blockage.\r\n<h4>What Can You Do About It?</h4>\r\nMild cases of constipation in dogs typically resolve themselves with time, but more severe cases may require intervention. If your dog has only been constipated for a day or two, something as simple as stirring a little canned pumpkin (the human-grade variety is perfect!) into his food can provide a boost of fiber that might get things moving again. Increasing your dog’s <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water intake </a>or switching to <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fresh food diet </a>with natural moisture can help as well.\r\n\r\nIf neither of these relieve your dog’s constipation, you may want to talk to your veterinarian about a stool softener, laxative, or other medication to help get your dog’s digestion back on track. In some cases, an enema might become necessary to evacuate the bowel, but this is definitely not something you should try at home.\r\n<h4>How Do You Prevent Constipation?</h4>\r\nOlder dogs are more likely to develop constipation because their bowel activity naturally decreases with age. If your dog doesn’t drink a lot of water, he is also at risk for developing constipation. So, how do you prevent your dog from becoming constipated?\r\n\r\nThe best thing you can do is feed your pup a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy, high-quality diet</a> that includes fresh, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real food</a>. Make sure your dog’s diet has plenty of protein and healthy fats as well as digestible carbohydrates for dietary fiber. You may also want to consider supplementing with <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/does-your-dog-need-probiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probiotics</a> to help ensure healthy and regular digestion.\r\n\r\nThough constipation is usually a short-lived problem that resolves itself with time, chronic or prolonged constipation is not something you should ignore.

Grooming practices vary from breed to breed, and factors like bathing, brushing, and diet all have an impact on your dog’s reflection. Let’s get into the importance and logistics of keeping your dog healthy on the outside, too.\r\n<h5><strong>Why do we brush and bathe our dogs in the first place?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlthough bathing seems like it would be the more important of the two, brushing actually has a much greater impact on your dog’s health.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBrushing removes dead skin cells from your dog’s body and helps to stimulate and redistribute the natural oils that give his coat that lustrous shine. With regular brushings (ideally every couple of days), you’ll also start to know your dog’s body like the back of your hand. This means that if any potentially worrisome growths pop up, you’ll notice and get them checked out by your vet quickly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your dog is a shedder, there’s likely no amount of brushing in the world that will save you (or your couch) from stray hairs. Still, brushing does remove loose hairs and also untangles any matted hair that has built up. This is a plus since you probably don’t want your dog walking around looking like a mop with eyes (unless you have a Puli). Breeds like Poodles, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels are all more prone to mats. Make grooming a priority if your dog has a long coat or is a heavy shedder!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBetween regular brushings and attention to overall hygiene (i.e. teeth, nails, and eye gunk), your dog can probably get away with a bath every month or two, barring a fondness for manure or other funky smelling shenaningans. Just make sure you’re using dog shampoo, as the human variety would throw your dog’s pH balance out of whack, leaving his skin vulnerable to rashes and parasites.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>Grooming by coat type</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe specific techniques you should employ when grooming your dog will vary depending on the type of hair your pup is sporting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn general, dogs with shorter, slicker coats need fewer baths and grooming sessions than those with longer, thicker hair. Not sure what type of brush to use on your dog? Options include a bristle, pin, or slicker brush. The bristle brush is generally used for smoother coats, the pin is best for longer hair, and the slicker works on either mane. The advantage of the slicker brush is its unique ability to remove loose hairs that would otherwise end up on your couch, carpet, or face.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome dogs also have an undercoat, which is – you guessed it – a second coat beneath the topcoat of fur. The undercoat is meant to keep your dog warm in the winter, but when summer arrives he will shed like crazy. If you don’t want your apartment swimming in dog hair, get yourself a special tool called an undercoat rake.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How does your dog’s diet affect coat health?</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSufficient protein and fat content are both crucial for a healthy coat. Roughly 75% of dog hair is made up of protein, so if your dog has a protein deficiency, his coat is going to suffer. Keep an eye out for dry or brittle fur, or even patches of hair loss; a simple tweak to your dog’s diet, like adding a fresh, high quality protein source, can improve the issue.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFats get a pretty bad rap (they should really fire their publicist), but healthy fats are essential for your dog’s skin and hair. The important ones here are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (both of which you can find in superfoods like olive oil!). Omega-3s help to reduce general inflammation, which can cut down on dander and combat any bites or allergies, while omega-6s stimulate hair growth. A healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids ultimately results in a strong and lustrous coat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you think your dog might have an omega-3 or omega-6 deficiency, you can supplement his diet with fish or flaxseed oil or switch to a fresh, balanced meal plan. If you’re home cooking for your dog or supplementing yourself, check in with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure that you’re feeding a balanced diet. Brushing, bathing, and feeding your dog right?

In addition to the emotional distress that Halloween can cause, that bowl of candy by the front door is also treacherous for any pet. Keep your dog away from these tricks in the treat bucket this Halloween.\r\n<h5>Chocolate</h5>\r\nWhether or not you have kids, chocolate is bound to make its way into your house this Halloween. Most dog owners are already aware of the dangers of chocolate for dogs, but here’s a quick refresher. The villain is a molecule found in chocolate known as <em>theobromine,</em> which is very difficult for dogs to digest. Not all chocolate is equally poisonous; dark chocolate contains more than six times the amount of the deadly molecule than milk chocolate, which means those Kit Kat Halloween Darkness candies are especially spooky. Smaller dogs are at a greater risk of getting sick than bigger breeds, and symptoms include vomiting, seizures, diarrhea, and increased heart rate. If ingested in large quantities, this sinister treat can lead to death, so keep that candy bowl far out of reach.\r\n<h5>Garlic</h5>\r\nGarlic is a key weapon in the fight against vampires, but it can also have adverse effects on your dog’s health. Garlic contains thiosulfate which damages red blood cells and can cause anemia. This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n<h5>Raisins</h5>\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n<h5>Candy</h5>\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach. Instead of chocolate or candy, chop up some <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh treats</a> for your dog to enjoy, like apples or carrots. They may not be as decadent as your treats, but your dog’s health is a far better investment. Someone needs to be around to keep you safe during those scary movies.\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/">@butterandwilson</a></em>', 'Keep your dog safe from these tricks in halloween treats', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '82-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 10:17:53', '2018-04-09 10:17:53', '', 82, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/82-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This can lead to jaundice and dark colored urine if your pup ingests it in large quantities, as well as diarrhea, stomach pain, and dehydration. So if you decide to hang garlic up around your haunted house, make sure it doesn’t get in your dog’s mouth. Unless, of course, your dog is actually a vampire.\r\n<h5>Raisins</h5>\r\nTrick or treaters can all unite over a shared disdain for that box of raisins in the treat bucket, and your dog is no different. Raisins and grapes are extremely toxic to your dog’s health and can lead to acute kidney failure. Some other common symptoms to look out for are diarrhea, lethargy and stomach pain. So if you’re trick or treating this year, skip the house with the bad candy; you’ll all be happier.\r\n<h5>Candy</h5>\r\nEven non-chocolate candies can be toxic for your dog’s health due to an ingredient known as xylitol. This spooky, sugar-free sweetener can be found in lollipops, gum, Jello-O, and some brands of peanut butter. Xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin increase in dogs which can lead to a sharp decrease in blood sugar and cause hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\nKeep your dog safe this year by keeping that bag of treats out of reach.

(322, 1, '2018-04-09 10:21:03', '2018-04-09 10:21:03', 'My dogs have two moods: manic and sleepy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe live in a ranch with a long hallway that stretches from one end of the house to the other, and in their most manic moments my dogs like to sprint back and forth, breathlessly racing each other to an invisible finish line. They spend the rest of their days sprawled out on our wooden floors in a way that honestly makes them look pretty dead.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut there’s a big difference between dogs who enjoy snoozing in a patch of sunlight after a long day of sprints and ones who are consistently lethargic. Not sure which camp your dog lies in? Let’s take a look.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Signs of lethargy</em> in dogs include napping way more than usual and a diminished interest in eating or drinking. Lethargic dogs can also have delayed responses to external stimuli, like someone calling their name or tossing them a tennis ball. In other words, dogs get dazed and confused, too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour dog might be lethargic after a particularly long day and can perk back up in as little as 24 hours, but if you notice signs of lethargy for days at a time, you might want to consider other causes. Like in humans, lethargy in dogs can be caused by both physical and mental issues like <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/causes-of-dog-diarrhea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diarrhea</a>, <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehydration</a>, and infection, as well as <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> and depression. When coupled with any of these ailments, lethargy is a sign that it’s time to see the vet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are at-home ways to improve your dog’s energy levels, too. An <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/cooking-for-your-dog-watch-out-for-these-nutrient-deficiencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improperly balanced</a> or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly processed</a> diet can lead to the same sluggish feelings of lethargy you experience after eating pasta for three days straight. Consider adding fresh foods like  <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vegetables </a>(or <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/sardines-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sardines</a> if you’re feeling creative) to your dog’s bowl for a boost of nutrients and energy. Research shows that fresh food can help build strong immunity and increase vitality in dogs, so you can also switch your pup to a regular diet of <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real, unprocessed food</a> to kick that 3pm slump for good.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA Saturday in bed is necessary every once in a while, but we all know fitness is in and the same goes for your dog. Adding extra <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/10-tips-for-getting-active-with-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercise to your dog’s routine</a> can help balance energy levels and give you both a little more pep in your step. What you do with that energy (like, say, sprinting down hallways until you pass out) is up to you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a class="_2g7d5 notranslate _iadoq" title="theobonaparte" href="https://www.instagram.com/theobonaparte/">@theobonaparte</a></em>', 'Why is my dog so lethargic?', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '80-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 10:21:03', '2018-04-09 10:21:03', '', 80, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/80-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Therapy dogs go a step even further, as they can help improve a host of mental and physical ailments. Here is a closer look at what therapy dogs do, the science behind their efficacy, and the steps you can take to get <em>your</em> pup certified.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>What is a therapy dog?</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\nFor starters, a therapy dog is not the same thing as a service dog (it’s also not a dog with a prescription pad and PhD). A service dog is trained to provide assistance to someone with a specific disability such as blindness, epilepsy, or PTSD.

(333, 1, '2018-04-09 11:49:45', '2018-04-09 11:49:45', 'Once upon a time, having dogs in the office seemed like something out of a tech startup fairy tale; a beaming Yellow Labrador Retriever running up to a handsome CEO in a loft filled with busy engineers, the Golden Gate Bridge glistening through a window.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut these days, more and more companies across a wide range of industries and cities are adopting dog-friendly offices. Obviously, being surrounded by puppies all day would make anyone happy, but research shows that having dogs in the workplace can <em>actually</em> benefit your health, your boss, and your “profit margin.” (Is that what they call it? I majored in English.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDon’t believe me? Over the next few months we’ll be interviewing people from a variety of cities and industries about how bringing their working dogs to the office has impacted their lives, careers, and mental health. But first, a word from science.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Benefits of dogs in the workplace:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dogs make everything better. Even Excel spreadsheets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2. Happier employees = more productive employees.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3. Having a dog-friendly workplace creates a welcoming and warm energy, which can help with team building and recruiting. Allowing employees to bring their dogs to work also cuts the potential cost of dog walkers and daycare from their budgets, enabling them to save money five days a week.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n4. On a similar note, letting employees bring dogs to work removes the stress of tight time constraints — there’s less pressure to run home to feed or walk the dog at the end of the day. One 2008 survey of both small and big companies showed that dog-friendly offices had employees who were willing to work longer hours as well as lower rates of employee absenteeism. Employees working alongside their dogs are more inclined to stick around, finish work without feeling rushed, and go home when they’re ready.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n5. Like I said before, this is all backed by #science. <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/study-office-dogs-reduce-work-related-stress.html">A 2012 study</a> from Virginia Commonwealth University found that employees surrounded by dogs in the workplace were less stressed than those who left their pets at home. Randolph Barker, a leader on <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/17538351211215366">the VCU study</a> published in the International Journal of Workplace Health Management, described the outcome as a “low cost wellness benefit.” (I’m nailing economic theory right now.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n6. In the same study, researchers found that employees with in-office dogs reported higher productivity. Both of these benefits might be attributed to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone that decreases stress in the human body. Oxytocin, also known as the “cuddle hormone,” is released when bonding socially, snuggling, or petting and interacting with animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n7. Dogs foster a more collaborative work environment. Who needs a water cooler when you can gather ‘round a dog? Meet your cute new co-worker over a petting sesh. Everyone bonds over belly rubs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n8. Walking, feeding, or playing with a dog is a nice way to <a href="https://www.inc.com/jordan-smith/companies-find-stress-reducing-benefits-of-office-dogs.html">break up your work day</a>. We already know that sitting at a desk for nine hours isn’t great for your health. Taking a walk around the block (or even just to the treats jar at the front of the office) with your pup is an incentive to get moving in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHave a working dog who makes office life better?

This Thanksgiving, we’re digging into the concept of family as it pertains to our pups.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Do dogs recognize their own canine family members?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTechnically, yes. Research shows that dogs exhibit recognition for both their littermates and biological mothers. In one study, 5-week-old puppies were released into a room with wire enclosures on either side. One side housed the puppies’ mothers and littermates, while the other housed random puppies and adult female dogs. In both instances, the puppies were significantly more likely to walk over to the side of the room with their relatives than the side with strangers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nResearchers hypothesized that these results were based on scent cues, and went on to successfully test this theory by repeating the study using towels with each dog’s scent instead of the dogs themselves. The results were nearly identical. Taking it one step further, they repeated the study with 2-year-old-dogs who hadn’t seen their mothers since they were 8 weeks old to see if recognition stood the test of time. Both mothers and puppies recognized each other more than 75% of the time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese findings may seem heartwarming, but recognition doesn’t necessarily mean that dogs miss or yearn for their relatives when they’re apart. Rather, these studies prove more about the link between recognition and scent cues than an awareness of familial bonds. So yes, dogs recognize their canine relatives. But do they feel the same kind of love for their mothers that we feel for them?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>How do dogs relate to their human families?</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere’s actually an encouraging difference between the way dogs recognize familiar dogs and  familiar humans. Scent still drives this type of recognition, but dogs don’t just see humans as another member of their pack.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn one study, a reward response was evoked in the brains of dogs who recognized the scent of a familiar human. This is a completely different response than the one triggered by recognizing another dog. (See: the way your dog acts on the sidewalk, pulling you in the direction of random dogs, while remaining disinterested in passing humans.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn other words, dogs know that humans aren’t<em> </em>like them, but they reserve a special part of their brains for the love and companionship we can provide. They’re not about to flash those <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/puppy-dog-eyes-feel-guilt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puppy eyes</a> at another dog, because they know dogs can’t provide kisses, belly rubs, or bowls of <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delicious food.</a> They love their caretakers because we help them meet fundamental needs they can’t satisfy on their own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo this Thanksgiving, while you’re relishing the smell of home (aka butter) with your family, remember: your pup is also forming scent memories.

Unaltered female dogs produce a very specific scent when they’re in heat, and intact male dogs will often wander off in order to find them. This is an easy “fix;” getting your dog spayed or neutered will not only stop your pet from wandering away, but also help keep the pet population under control.

If your dog is consistently <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/coping-with-an-anxious-pup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">afraid of certain situations</a>, consult your vet for the best course of treatment. Designate a safe, quiet area for your dog or consider medication if your pup needs extra assistance staying calm during especially nerve wracking events.\r\n<h4>New Surroundings</h4>\r\nMoving is chaotic enough without having to account for another being’s emotional state, but don’t forget to consider your pup. It’s challenging for dogs to understand the concept of a new, permanent home and they may try to run back to their old familiar digs. If possible, unpack familiar items first and let your pup acclimate to his new environment slowly. After a bit of time, patience, and plenty of love, he will come to understand that this is his new home.\r\n<h4>Bad Habits</h4>\r\nWe often don’t know a dog’s full history when we adopt and bring him home. If he was able to roam spontaneously before and that freedom has now been taken away, it might be hard for him to learn the new rules. It will take some training and positive reinforcement to correct this kind of behavior, so working with a trainer is recommended.\r\n<h4>Excitement</h4>\r\nJust like little kids running after an ice cream truck, dogs can get easily excited by new distractions and forget their training. Squirrels, other dogs, and cats can all be tempting to chase after. My Labrador, for instance, would often run to construction sites to find workers who would gladly share their lunches with him. To correct this, make sure your dog is leashed while on walks or that your yard is secured.\r\n<h4>Opportunity</h4>\r\nIf your dog digs under the fence or bolts out the front door when it’s open, it may be time to invest in some new systems. Put stones under the fence and always put his leash on before anyone opens the front door.\r\n\r\nNo matter how well you think you know your dog’s behavioral tendencies, it’s important that all dogs are microchipped and always wearing tags. In the unfortunate event that your dog roams a little too far, these precautions will help ensure that whoever locates him can get him back to you.\r\n\r\nIf your dog has gone missing, let local police, shelters, and animal control know right away. You may also want to reach out to local vets, groomers, pet stores, and animal hospitals. Send them a current picture of your pup along with your contact information and the best way to reach you.

Unaltered female dogs produce a very specific scent when they’re in heat, and intact male dogs will often wander off in order to find them.

It’s challenging for dogs to understand the concept of a new, permanent home and they may try to run back to their old familiar digs. If possible, unpack familiar items first and let your pup acclimate to his new environment slowly. After a bit of time, patience, and plenty of love, he will come to understand that this is his new home.\r\n<h5>Bad Habits</h5>\r\nWe often don’t know a dog’s full history when we adopt and bring him home.

It will take some training and positive reinforcement to correct this kind of behavior, so working with a trainer is recommended.\r\n<h5>Excitement</h5>\r\nJust like little kids running after an ice cream truck, dogs can get easily excited by new distractions and forget their training. Squirrels, other dogs, and cats can all be tempting to chase after. My Labrador, for instance, would often run to construction sites to find workers who would gladly share their lunches with him. To correct this, make sure your dog is leashed while on walks or that your yard is secured.\r\n<h5>Opportunity</h5>\r\nIf your dog digs under the fence or bolts out the front door when it’s open, it may be time to invest in some new systems.

Over the next few months we’ll be interviewing people from a variety of cities and industries about how bringing their working dogs to the office has impacted their lives, careers, and mental health.

On a similar note, letting employees bring dogs to work removes the stress of tight time constraints — there’s less pressure to run home to feed or walk the dog at the end of the day. One 2008 survey of both small and big companies showed that dog-friendly offices had employees who were willing to work longer hours as well as lower rates of employee absenteeism. Employees working alongside their dogs are more inclined to stick around, finish work without feeling rushed, and go home when they’re ready.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n5. Like I said before, this is all backed by #science. <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/study-office-dogs-reduce-work-related-stress.html">A 2012 study</a> from Virginia Commonwealth University found that employees surrounded by dogs in the workplace were less stressed than those who left their pets at home. Randolph Barker, a leader on <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/17538351211215366">the VCU study</a> published in the International Journal of Workplace Health Management, described the outcome as a “low cost wellness benefit.” (I’m nailing economic theory right now.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n6. In the same study, researchers found that employees with in-office dogs reported higher productivity. Both of these benefits might be attributed to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone that decreases stress in the human body. Oxytocin, also known as the “cuddle hormone,” is released when bonding socially, snuggling, or petting and interacting with animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n7. Dogs foster a more collaborative work environment. Who needs a water cooler when you can gather ‘round a dog? Meet your cute new co-worker over a petting sesh. Everyone bonds over belly rubs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n8. Walking, feeding, or playing with a dog is a nice way to <a href="https://www.inc.com/jordan-smith/companies-find-stress-reducing-benefits-of-office-dogs.html">break up your work day</a>. We already know that sitting at a desk for nine hours isn’t great for your health. Taking a walk around the block (or even just to the treats jar at the front of the office) with your pup is an incentive to get moving in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHave a working dog who makes office life better?

(346, 1, '2018-04-09 12:14:24', '2018-04-09 12:14:24', 'Once upon a time, having dogs in the office seemed like something out of a tech startup fairy tale; a beaming Yellow Labrador Retriever running up to a handsome CEO in a loft filled with busy engineers, the Golden Gate Bridge glistening through a window.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut these days, more and more companies across a wide range of industries and cities are adopting dog-friendly offices. Obviously, being surrounded by puppies all day would make anyone happy, but research shows that having dogs in the workplace can <em>actually</em> benefit your health, your boss, and your “profit margin.” (Is that what they call it? I majored in English.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDon’t believe me? Over the next few months we’ll be interviewing people from a variety of cities and industries about how bringing their working dogs to the office has impacted their lives, careers, and mental health. But first, a word from science.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Benefits of dogs in the workplace:</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Dogs make everything better. Even Excel spreadsheets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2. Happier employees = more productive employees.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3. Having a dog-friendly workplace creates a welcoming and warm energy, which can help with team building and recruiting. Allowing employees to bring their dogs to work also cuts the potential cost of dog walkers and daycare from their budgets, enabling them to save money five days a week.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n4. On a similar note, letting employees bring dogs to work removes the stress of tight time constraints — there’s less pressure to run home to feed or walk the dog at the end of the day. One 2008 survey of both small and big companies showed that dog-friendly offices had employees who were willing to work longer hours as well as lower rates of employee absenteeism. Employees working alongside their dogs are more inclined to stick around, finish work without feeling rushed, and go home when they’re ready.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n5.

(349, 1, '2018-04-09 12:29:37', '2018-04-09 12:29:37', 'Parsley is a bright green herb native to the Mediterranean region and cultivated throughout the world. Used both as garnish and an ingredient, parsley comes in several different varieties. Flat-leaf parsley, also known as Italian parsley, has large, flat leaves and adds robust flavors in cooking (think soups, stews, and sauces) while curly parsley is primarily used for decoration. But it’s more than just a pretty face.\r\nThe Stats:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPer tablespoon of chopped herb, parsley contains just 1 calorie and no fat or cholesterol. It contains less than 1 gram of carbohydrates, fiber, and protein but it is fairly rich in Vitamins A, C, and K as well as trace minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Parsley also boasts several volatile oils which have natural anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their antimicrobial and carminative benefits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to parsley for dogs, you should only feed the curly variety. Watch those serving sizes, as parsley does contain a toxic compound called furanocoumarin which can be dangerous in excessive amounts. In smaller servings, however, parsley does your dog more good than harm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Benefits:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Freshens bad breath thanks to microbial properties\r\n2. Rich in antioxidants that protect against free-radical damage\r\n3. Relieves swelling and pain from arthritis and other inflammatory conditions\r\n4. Vitamin K content improves blood clotting and boosts liver health\r\n5. Helps soothe upset stomach and digestive problems\r\n6. Diuretic properties help prevent urinary tract infections\r\n7. Immune system support via Vitamin C\r\n8. Helps flush toxins from the body, supporting kidney health\r\n9. Vitamin A content supports vision and eye health\r\n10. Can slow the rate of growth for tumors and certain cancers\r\nHow to Feed It:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWondering how to incorporate parsley into your dog’s diet? He may not chomp down on a fresh bunch right off the bat, but adding a little to his regular food a few times a week should do the trick. If you’re concerned about accidentally giving your dog too much parsley, play it safe by blending with water (1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of bodyweight) and creating a juice you can pour right into your his water bowl. You can also brew parsley root into a tea (1 teaspoon per 10 pounds of bodyweight), or bake some into homemade dog treats.

We know to monitor our sodium intake, avoid carrageenan and high fructose corn syrup, and understand that even organic, all-natural potato chips are still chips.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPet food products, however, remain a mystery. <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-history-of-commercial-pet-food-a-great-american-marketing-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet food marketing</a> aims to paint a picture of health (think: images of farms and fresh vegetables on a shelf-stable bag of brown kibble), and every company promises to be the best option for your dog. It’s tempting to throw in the towel on label vigilance in the pet food aisle and blindly believe the bags, but understanding your dog’s food labels is just as important as carefully examining your own.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStep one: learn to recognize the food label tricks that most pet companies are using.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>First ingredient</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust because an ingredient is listed first on a label, doesn’t mean it’s the most potent in the product. Pet food companies know that most consumers are searching for a real meat source in that prized first ingredient slot. It’s for this reason that they break up their ingredients into various equal amounts to trick consumers who are simply scanning for that premiere protein.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor example, a product label containing 20% meat and 80% starches could either look like:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRice (30%), peas (30%), Beef (20%), potatoes (20%)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>or:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeef (10%), beef heart (10%), long grain rice (10%), brown rice (10%), white rice (10%), split peas (10%), pea protein (10%), english peas (10%), potato (10%), potato starch (10%).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn top of this, pet food labels are created before the product is cooked and processed, meaning the meat weighs significantly more. Beef loses weight (i.e. moisture) in the cooking process, while rice gains weight. This means those starches end up occupying even more volume in the final product.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>“With…”</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA pet food bag claiming to be filled “with chicken” or “with real beef” is trickier than you’d assume. “With” simply means that the aforementioned ingredients must not make up less than 3% of the product’s total weight. Many pet owners purchase bags made “with” ingredients they recognize, not realizing that they are only technically required to make up 3% of the total package. The other 97%? Decidedly less familiar.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>100% organic</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBranding a product organic has become a proxy for actual nutrition information. A quick refresher: organic foods must be made without the use of antibiotics, artificial growth hormones, high fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes (which, btw, can be made from things like coal tar), artificial sweeteners derived from chemicals, synthetically created chemical pesticide and fertilizers, genetically engineered protein, sewage sludge, and irradiation. In other words, food deemed “organic” should really just be called “food,” because neither you nor your pup should be eating any of the other stuff, anyway.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut even organic cookies shouldn’t be eaten all day, every day in lieu of fresh food. (And for the record, all commercial kibble — even the organic variety — is so highly processed that much of the nutritional integrity of any individual ingredient is lost by the time it reaches your dog’s bowl.) Watch out for bags touting “organix” ingredients. Not entirely sure what “organix” means? We aren’t either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Made “with” organic ingredients</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis bold promise simply means that 70% of the ingredients in a product with this label are considered organic, while a product labeled “all organic” guarantees that 95% of the total ingredients meet this criteria. But, again, organic doesn’t mean much when an ingredient has been burnt to a crisp and exposed to heat and moisture during extrusion, the process through which kibble is made.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Feed-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFeed-grade is a far cry from food. Pet products with this label are not held to food safety standards and are considered unsuitable for human ingestion. Practically any ingredient is suitable for a feed-grade product, including waste, fats and grease, and dead animals from farms, ranches, and shelters. Some feed-grade pet products do use higher quality ingredients, but there is no method for consumers to differentiate between feed grade products.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Human-grade</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis term simply means that a product in its entirety (not just individual ingredients) is safe for human consumption. A truly human grade pet food must be manufactured according to food safety standards and made with 100% food ingredients and human-grade supplements. This label has everything to do with safety and quality, and little to do with cook process. A wide array of pet foods — including kibble, fresh, and dehydrated — can all be human grade, with varying degrees of natural nutrients depending on how they are prepared. By regulation, raw pet foods are not allowed to claim that they are human grade.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Natural</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe USDA defines “natural” as a product that has no artificial ingredients or added color, but doesn’t account for additives like antibiotics, growth hormones, or other chemicals. The term is so broad that the FDA is still struggling to come up with a legal definition for it. Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible.

Legally speaking, there is no required difference between foods labeled “all-natural” and “natural.” Natural is not necessarily organic, but organic must be considered natural.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Gourmet</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe associate the term with fresh veggies and farm-to-table dining, but there are no legal regulations that determine when this term can be used on food labels.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grain-free</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA product sans grain is technically free of corn, soy, wheat, barley, and oats. Grain-free products, however, are not necessarily low-carb; in reality, grain-free dog foods tend to have just as many carbohydrates as dog food that is not grain-free, especially when high-starch items, like potatoes, are used to replace grain.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Cage-free and/or free-range</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Cage-free” is exactly what it sounds like: poultry that hasn’t been raised in a cage. But don’t be fooled — cage-free isn’t as free or spacious as it sounds. Chickens raised for meat (even those that are “cage-free”) are typically kept in tight, indoor spaces that are cramped and uncomfortable. By USDA definition, “cage-free” and “free-range” only require that animals have had access to the outside.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Grass-fed</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough we might often associate “grass-fed” with “free-range,” one does not guarantee the other. Technically speaking, cows can be grass-fed and still contained, only let out to graze for short periods at a time. Though the USDA regulates how the term is used on labels, it does not regulate how, in practice, the “grass-fed” animals are actually fed.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we recommend feeding only from the <a href="http://thefarmersdog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best dog food companies</a> you know you can trust, and ideally choosing <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/6-benefits-of-feeding-human-grade-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh food</a> whenever possible. Stick to foods you can see and the whole feeding process becomes a lot less tricky.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenikrauze/">@jenikrauze</a></em>', 'The 11 Dog Food Label Tricks Every Owner Needs to Know', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '145-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 12:31:13', '2018-04-09 12:31:13', '', 145, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/145-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(352, 1, '2018-04-09 12:32:33', '2018-04-09 12:32:33', 'There’s a common misconception that if you aren’t ready to<a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-rescue-runways-guide-to-adopting-a-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> adopt a dog</a>, you can’t help a homeless pet. While adoption is one of the biggest ways to make an impact, it’s certainly not the only one. Here are a few creative ways you can get involved and make a real difference in the lives of rescue pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Foster</h5>\r\nMany people can’t commit to a permanent adoption due to busy schedules, traveling, or expenses. Holding off on adopting is a responsible decision when you know you can’t care for an animal long-term, but if you have a two or four week opening on your calendar, fostering might be for you. Plenty of local rescues need foster homes for animals, and sometimes organizations will even pay for all the expenses as long as you can provide love and shelter. It might be hard to say goodbye at the end of the foster stay, but remember that you’ve helped free up space for that organization to take in even more animals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Volunteer</h5>\r\nWalk into any shelter and ask if they need help and you’ll be hard pressed to find one that will turn you down. It takes a village to run any nonprofit and when you have animals that need to be cared for, it’s that much more important to have volunteers. Whether you’re looking to help with marketing, fundraising, or simply want to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/the-importance-of-letting-your-dog-sniff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk dogs</a>, your skill set and time will be put to good use.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Educate</h5>\r\nSo you’re allergic to anything with four legs but still want to help in the plight to save animals. Become an educator! Often times, rescues already have some sort of program in place to educate the community about helping their local pet population. You can go to schools, religious organizations, or businesses and host a discussion on spay/neuter, how to <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dangerous-items-dogs-hiding-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">care for pets</a>, and why adoption is important. Education is one of the most powerful tools in the fight against homelessness for pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Fundraise</h5>\r\nIf you like to host events or plan parties, consider organizing a fundraiser for your local shelter. It can be as simple as a bake sale or as extravagant as a gala; anything you can contribute will be an asset. Partner with a local boutique for a Shop Your Cause event, or ask your gym to host a workout fundraiser. Get creative with it and do something that you enjoy. In the end, your local shelter will appreciate whatever amount you raise.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>Donate</h5>\r\nIf you’re short on time and resources, skip that latte and donate $5 to a rescue of your choice instead. If you want to make a more direct impact, many organizations have a <a href="http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/hurricane-harvey-how-to-help/">wish list</a> of items they need. You can usually find these lists under the donations tab on their website, or you can reach out to them directly and ask. Whether you can gift a blanket or a month’s supply of heart worm medication, your donation will help an animal in need.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butterandwilson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@butterandwilson</a></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Here’s How to Help Homeless Dogs Without Adopting', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '210-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-04-09 12:32:33', '2018-04-09 12:32:33', '', 210, 'http://localhost/MADS-foodog/wordpress/index.php/2018/04/09/210-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);
